Given the entire book text and a short claim, determine whether the claim is supported, not supported or not present in the book according to these guidelines:

1. Supported: The claim is directly supported by the text. Add a short explanation of why by giving specific evidence from the text.
2. Not Supported: The claim mentions a fact that clearly contradicts to the actual text. Add a short explanation of why by giving specific evidence from the text.
3. Not Present: The claim mentions a fact that is not present in the text. Add a short explanation of why in 1-2 sentences and try to include evidence that is similar to the claim but is fundamentally different.
