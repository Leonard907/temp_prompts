Accounts that I created...And then the strangest thing happened: even though Id given up on bringing him to justice, I continued to maintain the account. Shots of artisan coffee shops, of peonies, of window seats youd like to sit in. Things that made it seem to me like you were still alive. A way of keeping you with me, I suppose. As though, if an avatar of you is out there on Instagram, your light hasnt yet gone out, not yet, not yet, not yet...I set up your profile, initially to catfish Andrew, later to pay homage to you." and "It was all there. Andrew didnt noticemen, eh? He probably thought everyone was just like you, just as funny and scintillating and sparkly as you. It was easy, really. After all, what is an identity? I had loads of them. That box of dud passports that failed to print. I chose the one with the most anodyne name, Olivia Johnson, and the one that reminded me of you, Sadie, and that lovely face you used to pull as a baby, Little O. And then I set up your profile, initially to catfish Andrew, later to pay homage to you." This provides direct textual evidence that Lewis created Olivia as a fictional character using a passport and a made-up online presence to get revenge for his daughter Sadie's disappearance.
