And now, Im here, collecting you, the way I have done a thousand times before. ... I have some evidence that might assist you. And I wanted you to know: he used to be known as Andrew. ... I have a QR code on it" and "Youre in only a T-shirt, and the hairs on your arms have risen up. I see now that it is a police officer at the door. Plain clothes, but holding up a badge, just like hes in a TV show. Immediately, my heart speeds up. Back in my own hell, your hell, from last year, when another policeman knocked at our door. Different door, same police force. Its just this, he is saying to you. He waves a transparent bag containing what looks like a swab. Wipe that around, er, the inside of your cheek if you could be so kind, he says cordially, like hes just asked you to donate money to charity, not your DNA to a police database.
