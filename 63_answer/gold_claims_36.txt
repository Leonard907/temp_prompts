Not Supported.

Explanation: While Julia does enlist Price's help to remove the bodycam footage and Price does kill Jonathan, the text does not state that Julia and Price arranged Jonathan's death to look like a suicide. The text clearly states that Price acted alone in murdering Jonathan to protect Julia after finding out she was in danger: "Price had used the element of surprise to grab the gun from Jonathan, and had shot him in the head, close range, right there, near his house on the beach; nobody knew it was him except Julia." Julia knew of the killing after the fact but did not arrange it or participate in making it look like a suicide.
