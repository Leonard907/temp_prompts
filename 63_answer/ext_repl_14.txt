Supported. Julia's actions throughout the book, particularly her choice to cover up Genevieve's crime and plant evidence to frame Matthew, are driven by personal motives and a desire to protect her family. This directly undermines her role as a police officer and makes her question her own pursuit of justice. The text states: "she will have committed another imprisonable offense. And, worse, violated some law againstwhat? Nature? Morals? She doesnt know. If she doesnt do it, though... Genevieve would get custody, time. Ten years, fifteen. It would depend on whether the jury believed it was manslaughter or murder. Too big a risk to take, in other words, which Julia had known immediately that night." and "And so the decision is made. Until she can find Olivia: dead or alive. Corruption. Just like that. Like jumping off a cliff, only what Julia didnt realize is that she had been walking steadily toward it since that night in the car park last year. It took one more step." These quotes clearly show Julia is making choices that go against what her role as a police officer demands, driven by what she feels is best for her and her daughter's wellbeing.
