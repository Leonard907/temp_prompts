Book Text: PART ONE September 1996 The First Week It was dark when I got to Cambridge. I pulled my mothers suitcase over the cobblestones toward the river. Riley had been really mad when we were assigned to Mather, and not to one of the historic ivy-covered brick buildings where young men had lived in ancient times with their servants. But I wasnt into history, so I liked that the rooms in Mather were all singles, and nobody had to figure out how to share an irregularly sized suite where people had lived with their servants. I hadnt spoken to Ivan since July, when we said goodbye in a parking lot on the Danube. We hadnt exchanged phone numbers, since we were both going to be traveling, and anyway we never had talked much on the phone. But I had never doubted that, when I got back to school, I would find an email from him, explaining everything. It was not, after all, conceivable that there was no explanation, or that the explanation could come from anyone else, or that it could come in any way other than email, since that was how everything had always happened between us. Mather resembled an alien starship: impregnable, simultaneously ancient and futuristic, gathering its powers. I held my ID card in front of the reader, and the door to the computer room clicked open. I found myself remembering a book Id read where a woman looked in a mirror for the first time after seven years in a gulag, and the face looking back wasnt her own, but that of her mother. I immediately recognized how shameful, self-important, and obtuse it was for me, an American college student who hadnt checked email for three months, to compare herself to a political prisoner who had spent seven years in a gulag. But it was too lateI had already thought of it. I mistyped my password twice before I got it right. Information started cascading down the screen, first about the computer itself and the different protocols it was using, then about when and where it had last seen me, and finally the sentence that sent a jolt to my heart: You have new mail. Ivans name was there, just like I had known it would be. Before reading the message through, I looked at it all at once, to see how long it was and what it was like. Right away, I could tell something was wrong. So something is wrong, I read. I saw the words shocked and monster: I am very shocked that you see me as such a monster, it said. I know you wont believe anything I say. And: I hope you will tell me why I am so horrible, so that I can defend myself. I had to reread the whole message twice before I understood that it was three months old. Ivan had sent it in June, in response to an angry email I had sent him before leaving campus. Technically, his reply had been invalidated by all the things that had happened between us in the intervening months. But it still felt like a new and final word from him, because, although there were several other messages in the in-box, none was from Ivan. He hadnt written anything to me at all since that day in the parking lotsince he had held me so close to him, and then gotten in his car and driven away. Most of the other emails were also months old and out-of-date. There was one from Peter that said, I desperately need to know your flight arrival time in Budapest, and another from Riley asking if it was OK to apply to overflow housing so we wouldnt have to live in Mather. Only two messages were from the past couple of days. One said that I had to see my financial aid officer at the earliest opportunity. The other, from the new president of the Turkish Students Association, said that somebody had found a store in Brookline that sold Kayseri-style pastrma: a kind of cured meat that some people said was etymologically related to pastrami. So if you like Kayseri-style pastirma, you can go there, his message concluded. I exited the email program and used the terrible finger command, to see where Ivan was. He had logged on from Berkeley two hours earlier. So he was there. He just wasnt writing to me. Svetlana got to campus the day after me, though it felt like years. I had already slept the night in my new room, eaten breakfast and lunch in the cafeteria, and made numerous trips back and forth to the storage facility, having the same conversation over and over. How was your summer? How was your summer? How was Hungary? I was dissatisfied by the vagueness of my own answers. I still hadnt figured out the right angle. How was Hungary? Lakshmi asked at lunch, with a conspiratorial sparkle. Did anything happen? Notwithstanding my strong feeling that a lot of things had happened, I answered the question truthfully in the sense that I knew Lakshmi intended it. Nothing had happened. Svetlana asked me the same question that evening, when we met at her warehouse-like suite in new Quincy, and sat on bean-bag chairs under an Edward Hopper poster, and talked about everything that had happened since the last time we had spokenwhen I had been in a phone booth in the Kl train station, and Svetlana had been at her grandmothers house in Belgrade. I told her how I had finally called Ivan in Budapest, how he had showed up with a canoe, and we had sat up all night at his parents house. Did anything happen? she asked, in a lazier, more amused voice than Lakshmis, but meaning the same thing. Well, like, that one thing didnt happen, I said. Oh, Selin, Svetlana said. When Ivan first told me about the summer program in Hungary, he said I should take my time to think about it, because he didnt want to force me into anything. Svetlana said that, if I agreed to go, Ivan was going to try to have sex with me. This was a possibility I had never previously considered. I daydreamed about Ivan all the time, imagining different conversations we might have, how he might look at me, touch my hair, kiss me. But I never thought about having sex. What I knew about having sex didnt correspond to anything I wanted or had felt. I had tried, on multiple occasions, to put in a tampon. Tampons were spoken of by older or more sophisticated girls as being somehow more liberated and feminist than maxi pads. I just put one in and forget about it. I felt troubled by the implication that a person was constantly thinking about their maxi pad. Nonetheless, every few months I would give tampons another shot. It was always the same. No matter what direction I pushed the applicator, however methodically I tried all the different angles, the result was a blinding, electric pain. I read and reread the instructions. Clearly I was doing something wrong, but what? It was worrisome, especially since I was pretty sure that a guythat Ivanwould be bigger than a tampon. But at that point my brain stopped being able to entertain it, it became unthinkable. Svetlana said I had better think about it. You wouldnt want to end up in that situation and not have thought about it, she said, reasonably. And yet, it turned out there wasnt much to think about. It was immediately obvious that if Ivan tried to have sex with me, I would let him. Maybe he would be able to tell me what I had been doing wrong, and it wouldnt be as terrible as trying to put in a tampon. But he hadnt tried, and all the nights we sat up late together, all we did was talk. Then he left for Thailand, at the end of July, and I still had another ten days in the village, surrounded by people who werent him. A strange thing: I had gone to Hungary in some way to understand Ivan better, because being Hungarian was such a big deal for himand it was only in the villages that I had realized, with a certain shock, that, although Hungarianness was a big part of Ivan, Ivan himself was only a very small part of Hungary. On some level, I had always known that Hungary was a whole country, home to millions of people who had never met Ivan, and didnt know or care about him. But apparently I hadnt completely thought it through, because it still felt like a surprise. Had that been when I lost the thread of the story I was telling myselfthe thread of the story about my life? Svetlanas trip to Belgradeher first time back since the warhad gone well, maybe thanks to all the preparation she had done with her shrink. There had been only one moment, at the store downstairs from her grandmothers apartment, when she had dropped a coin and bent over to pick it up, and suddenly remembered with horror how a milk bottle had once smashed on those particular floor tiles. She didnt remember what else had happened, or what had been so horrible. There was just the image of the glass splintering irretrievably in all directions, the blob of milk spreading over the dingy tiles like a diabolical hand. Spilled milk. Svetlana sighed. Sometimes I wish my subconscious would be a little more original. I wanted to hear more about it, but Svetlana was already thinking less about Belgrade than about the wilderness, where she had just come back from being a leader on a freshman pre-orientation program. I kept forgetting about the existence of the freshman pre-orientation programs. In addition to the outdoors one, there was an arts one, and a community-service one where you built houses for underprivileged people. You had to pay extra to do themeven the one where you built housesso it had never occurred to me to apply. But Svetlana had done the outdoors one as a freshman, and had had a profound experience that was related to the sublime. Listening to Svetlana talk, I fluctuated between believing that something really good had happened to her, and experiencing a profound sense of alienation. She described the intense relationships that she had formed with boring-sounding freshmen through trust exercises, games, and activities that had been devised, over the years, for just this purpose. She didnt seem disturbed, as I would have been, by the idea that it was an experience designed for you, to make you feel a certain way. An increasingly important role was played in Svetlanas narration by her co-leader, Scott. Each group had two leaders, a guy and a girl. I understood that it must have been exciting to have a shared mission with a guy, requiring coordination and discussions and responsibility. At the same time, there was something sinister about everyone being really into this camping-themed mom-and-dad dress-up. Did I only feel that way because my parents were divorced? Scott, who was into bluegrass and Zen, sounded like the kind of bland super-American dude who invariably found Svetlana hilarious. For some reason, guys like that always seemed negatively disposed toward me. When she got to the part about how Scott was a senior and had a girlfriend, Svetlanas tone implied that she was either steering away from, or ironically referring to, the comparison, immediately obvious to both of us, to Ivan. She kept emphasizing how specific her relationship to Scott was to the circumstances, because of how completely they had to trust each other, how they had to know each others bodies, how they had to help each other to climb different natural and man-made obstacles, and to carry the things their bodies needed to survive out there, enveloped day and night in the fathomless beauty of nature. How am I ever going to give you up from my life? Scott had asked Svetlana, on their last night together. Svetlana had told him that maybe it was for the best that their closeness was coming to an end there, since she was never so alive and intense as she was in the woods. I told him, I can be pretty lackluster in the winter, she said, leaning characteristically into the unusual word choice, and I wouldnt want to disappoint you. You dont have to talk like that, about disappointing me, Scott had replied. Its not like were going out. Why did I feel crushed? Svetlana was only quoting something Scott had said to her. It had nothing to do with me, and Svetlana herself didnt seem upset. Svetlana and I were sitting in her room reading the course catalog. It was a magical book. All human knowledge was in it, hidden in the form of its classification. It was like From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs.Basil E. Frankweiler, where the answer to whether the statue was really by Michelangelothe answer that would determine the meaningfulness of everything else that had happenedwas right there in the filing cabinets, and the children had only to find it, but first they had to guess what it was filed under. I thought there was something wrong with the way the departments and majors were organized. Why were the different branches of literature categorized by geography and language, while sciences were categorized by the level of abstraction, or by the size of the object of study? Why wasnt literature classified by word count? Why wasnt science classified by country? Why did religion have its own department, instead of going into philosophy or anthropology? What made something a religion and not a philosophy? Why was the history of non-industrial people in anthropology, and not in history? Why were the most important subjects addressed only indirectly? Why was there no department of love? I knew, even before I asked her, that Svetlana would defend the system of departmentsbut how? They were so clearly arbitrary categories that some guy had thought of. Well, of course theyre arbitrary, Svetlana said, but its because theyre historical categories, not formal categories. She said the course catalog was a relic of how human knowledge had been split into disciplines since Ancient Greece. You couldnt actually separate the knowledge from the history of how it had been conceived and organized, so that was the most meaningful way to study it: divided into historically determined categories. I was impressed by how smart Svetlana was, but I didnt agree. I thought we should be rewriting the categories and trying to think of a better organization than whichever one we happened to have inherited. In general, I mistrusted Svetlanas attitude toward historical influences, and other influences. She was constantly thinking about the influence of her parents. Nor was she unique in this respect. Half the people at Harvard, within five minutes of meeting you, they were telling you about the influence of their parents. People said it was universal to be obsessed with your parents, but I didnt feel that way. When we read Hamlet in high school I almost died of impatience. All I thought about at that time was getting outand Hamlet had done it, he was in college, and then he came back to get entangled in a gross drama related to his mothers sex life? Because his father told him to, in a pages-long outpouring of moralizing self-pity, where he didnt say anything to or about Hamlet, and just droned on about how lust was preying on garbage? And then Hamlet went around making cutting remarks to people about his mom? I had no patience for such a person. Last spring, months before we had to declare our majors, Svetlana had started soliciting advice from her parents and other old people. Her father had perversely withheld guidance, saying, I cant possibly know you any better than you know yourself. That was classic Svetlanas dad. He clearly thought he knew what she should do, but was teaching her a lesson. Her mother told her, Ask Gould, meaning that she should ask Stephen Jay Gould, because she had gone to his office hours once and they had had a two-hour conversation about the descent of man. How I envy you in this sea of choices, Svetlanas mother said. I wish I was you. Im so happy for you that sometimes I weep. Svetlana was pretending she hadnt chosen all her classes yet, but it was clear that she had. We were both taking accelerated Russian, which you had to do if you wanted to have any hope of reading an actual book in Russian before your four-year college education ran out. It counted as two classes. Once you added in a Core class, and a tutorial in your major, that was four classes, a full courseload. I was taking an extra class, though, so I could actually pick one that wasnt some kind of requirement. I didnt get why more people didnt take a fifth class. It didnt cost extra. All you had to do was fill out a petition and meet with a dean. Granted, such meetings were never pleasant. Behind a deans strained expression, you could glimpse some hidden mechanism ceaselessly translating everything you said into an expression of unreasonableness or immaturity. But, for some reason, the laws of their universe didnt allow them to openly oppose you. All they would do was smile fixedly and try to tell you not to take so many classes and, if you smiled fixedly back for long enough, they would eventually sign the petition. I opened the catalog to a random page. COMP LIT 140: Chance An incalculable amount of human effort is directed to combating and restricting the nuisance or danger represented by chance, Carl Jung writes in his foreword to the I Ching. We will consider attempts by modern artists and thinkers to redirect this effort, to use chance as an artistic praxis, a conduit to the subconscious, an egress from the constraints of memory and imagination.... My heart jumped when I learned that there was a literature class about chance, especially when I got to topics include the flneur and the random walk as the paradigmatic site of urban experience. Chance, probability, was what Ivan had gone to California to study, and his thesis had been about random walks! And flneurs were something that literature people talked about. I had never understood why; they would just say that someone was a flneur, or a voyeur, and seem satisfied. I knew that flneurs walked around, and voyeurs looked at things. This in itself did not seem interesting; nor was I sure why a random walk was a worthy object of study. Was it possible that these things were related? At the bottom of the description, it said that topics discussed would include Andr Bretons Surrealist strategies in Nadja, and this, too, felt like a sign, because the book Nadja had so often caught my eye in Svetlanas room: lightweight, with a striking minimalist cover, and numbered black-and-white photographs interspersed in the text. Once, while I was waiting for Svetlana to get out of the shower, I had read the first lines. Who am I? If this once I were to rely on a proverb, then perhaps everything would amount to knowing whom I haunt. The rest of the paragraph went on for pages. It seemed less interesting than wondering whom I haunted. Is this good? I asked, holding up the book, when the door opened and Svetlana came in, totally pink, with her hair up in a towel. She looked thoughtful. I dont know if you would like it. You can borrow it if you want. I turned to the last page. It said: Beauty will be CONVULSIVE or will not be at all. Maybe another time, I said, replacing the book on the shelf. Months later, Ivan had written me a long email about Fellini and clowns, and the last line had been: Beauty, Breton says, will be convulsive or will not be at all. I had resolved to look again at Nadja, the next time I was in Svetlanas room, to see if there were any context clues that might help with the clowns. But the school year had somehow ended without my ever again waiting for her in her room with time to spare, looking at her books. Now we already lived in different buildings, and soon we would live even farther away from each other, and she would be married, and I would never wait for her in her bedroom again. How brief and magical it was that we all lived so close to each other and went in and out of each others rooms, and our most important job was to solve mysteries. The temporariness made it all the more important to do the right thingto follow the right leads. It was exciting to turn the corner in the bookstore from Computer Science to Comparative Literatureto see the fat textbooks give way to normal-sized books with interesting covers that looked like a person might actually read them in the course of normal life. The books for the Chance class, however, had an off-putting coolness. Would I enjoy them? The books I enjoyed were usually long, containing descriptions of furniture and of somebody falling in love, and often had ugly nineteenth-century paintings on the cover. The Chance books were the kind of slim attractive books with wide margins, that I never actually felt like reading: books that were experimental or hybrid or postmodern or lyrical. Why were poems so expensive, when they had so few words? That Flowers of Evil cost thirty dollars! I opened to a random page: Don Juan in Hell. Women, their open dresses exposing pendant breasts, writhed under a dark sky and, like a herd of sacrificial victims, let trail behind a long drawn-out moan. What? Why were the women in hell? Thirty dollars? Then I noticed a fat Penguin Classics volume with a poorly reproduced nineteenth-century painting on the cover, and the white-on-black medallion read: SREN KIERKEGAARD EITHER/OR A Fragment of Life I picked up a secondhand copy$7.99and read the text on the back: Either, then, one is to live aesthetically or one is to live ethically. My heart was pounding. There was a book about this? I had first heard the phrase aesthetic life last year, in a class called Constructed Worlds. We were reading a French novel called Against Natureabout the degenerate scion of a noble family who retired to the country and devoted himself to decadent projects, like growing orchids that resembled meat, or more generally trying to get organic and inorganic objects to resemble each other. By the end of the book, I didnt think much of what that guy had accomplished. Still, I found the idea of an aesthetic life to be tremendously compelling. It was the first time I had heard of an organizing principle or goal you could have for your life, other than making money and having kids. Nobody ever said that that was their organizing principle, but I had often noticed it, when I was growing up: the way adults acted as though trying to go anywhere or achieve anything was a frivolous dream, a luxury, compared to the real work of having kids and making money to pay for the kids. Nobody ever explained what was admirable about having the kids, or why it was the default course of action for every single human being. If you ever asked why any particular person had had a kid, or what good a particular kid was, people treated it as a blasphemyas if you were saying they should be dead, or the kid should be dead. It was as if there was no way to ask what the plan had been, without implying that someone should be dead. One day, early in our friendship, Svetlana had spontaneously told me that she thought I was trying to live an aesthetic life, and that it was a major difference between us, because she was trying to live an ethical life. I wasnt sure why the two should be opposed, and worried for a moment that she thought that I thought that it was OK to cheat or steal. But she turned out to mean something else: that I took more risks than her and cared more than she did about style, while she cared more about history and traditions. Soon, the ethical and the aesthetic was the framework we used to talk about the ways we were different. When it came to choosing friends, Svetlana liked to surround herself with dependable boring people who corroborated her in her way of being, while I was more interested in undependable people who generated different experiences or impressions. Svetlana liked taking introductions and survey classes, mastering basics before moving to the next level, getting straight As. I had a terror of being bored, so I preferred to take highly specific classes with interesting titles, even when I hadnt taken the prerequisites and had no idea what was going on. I could see how my way might be called aesthetic. It was less clear to me why Svetlanas way was ethical, though it did seem responsible and obedient. It felt related, somehow, that Svetlana was so close to her father, and that it was from her father that she had first gotten into reading and debating philosophical and ethical questions. I could relate to this. When I was little, my father and I spent whole weekends driving around the countryside in New Jersey, just the two of us, stopping sometimes to pick apples at farms, or to watch birds in the nature preservebut mostly driving, listening to classical music, and talking about ethics, morality, and the meaning of life. I had loved those conversations. Yet, now, the word ethics made me impatient. When I tried to pinpoint when things had changed, I found myself remembering one evening when I was ten. I was doing homework in my room when my father knocked on the door and proposed going out on one of our long drives, even though it was a weeknight. In the car, my father asked if I agreed with him that there was nothing worse, ethically, than betrayal, and that women were particularly prone to betraying people. Clytemnestra, for example, had betrayed Agamemnon when he had one foot out of the bath, fulfilling the prophecy that Agamemnon would die neither on land nor at sea. I didnt know, until Svetlana told me, that Agamemnon had murdered his daughter as a sacrifice to the Trojan War. Thats what Clytemnestra was even mad about. None of this was anything I wanted to think about, or model my life on. According to the back cover, the first half of Either/Or was about the aesthetic life, and included a novella called The Seducers Diary, while the second half was about the ethical life, and consisted of some letters from a judge about marriage. So, the ethical life was related to getting married. It was somehow implicit in my friendship with Svetlana that she wanted to be in a stable relationship and to someday have children, while I wanted to have interesting love experiences that I could write about. Svetlana didnt seem to have enjoyed family life more than I had, but in her case it had made her want to have a do-over, to do well herself all the things that her parents had done badly. I, on the other hand, thought that my parents had been doomed; I didnt see how I could do any better than they had. Unsurprisingly, the back of Either/Or didnt say which kind of life was better. All it said was: Does Kierkegaard mean us to prefer one of the alternatives? Or are we thrown back on the existentialist idea of radical choice? That had probably been written by a professor. I recognized the professors characteristic delight at not imparting information. Still, I bought a copyalong with a secondhand Nadja. It seemed possible that one or both of these books might change my life. Sometimes it still felt weird that Svetlana and I werent rooming together. We had talked about it in the spring. Ours is definitely my most stimulating friendship, she had said, but I might feel threatened to live with someone who doesnt have a weaker personality than I do. Svetlana was the only person I knew who spoke so candidly. I would have been embarrassed to think, let alone say, that I felt threatened by other peoples strength of personality. I wouldnt even have admitted that I didnt think that all people were somehow equal in this respect. Once Svetlana said it, though, it seemed obvious and noncontroversial. Svetlana herself had the strongest personality of anyone I had ever metway stronger than mine. She would never have spent the summer in such a peripheral European nation, with so little connection either to her own past or to the great edifices of Western history and culture. Why, then, had she said that my personality was stronger? I decided that she was trying to be politeto make me feel less badly that she didnt want to live with me. On the other hand, when I thought about her freshman-year roommates, who were in her new housing block, their dynamic with Svetlana did seem to depend on a shared consensus about Svetlanas stronger personality. They were Svetlanas encouraging spectators, in sort of a feudal exchange for protection, tutelage, and entertainment. Where would I fit in? I couldnt imagine recruiting Dolores and Valerie to root for me, any more than I could imagine joining them to root for Svetlana. I couldnt imagine referring to each others stuffed animals by name, or taking turns bringing Guthrie, the platypus, to exams. Why did Svetlana want to do those things more than she wanted to spend time with me? When Riley asked me to room with her, I immediately agreed, even though I didnt know her that well. Riley was the most intransigent person I knew, and the funniest. Her closest friendsOak, Ezra, and Lucaswere guys, and were serious about comedy. Telling jokeslike getting in arguments, or playing ping-pongwas one of the many seemingly casual and non-professional human activities that turned out, in college, to be a rigorous, technical discipline that some people studied day and night, and pursued to a competitive career path. When I sat with them in the cafeteriaRiley, upright and self-contained like a cat, the three others with their long limbs extending variously over and under the table, and all of them shooting a joke back and forth, escalating for more steps than I thought possible, prosecuting its ramifications like fine points of the lawit seemed to me imperative to keep such people close to me, both to be cushioned against the vicissitudes of life, and to learn how they did it. It was hard to imagine Svetlana even having a conversation with Riley, let alone living with her. It was even harder to imagine Ivan talking to Riley, although this had actually happened once, in the spring, when Ivan had mysteriously turned up at the freshman cafeteria. It was one of many things he seemed to have done only to confound me. How are you even here? I asked. I was in the Science Center and didnt have time to get to my house. So I thought Id see if you were here. But Im meeting my friend. So can I eat with you and your friend? I led him to our table with mounting despair. This is my friend Riley, I said. This is Ivan. Hey, Riley said. Hey, Ivan said. I sat across from Riley and Ivan sat next to me. Riley glanced at Ivan, who was vigorously cutting up a Salisbury steak: something Riley would never have eaten. Then Oak, Ezra, and Lucas turned up, managing to seem like at least five people. They kept sitting down and jumping up and going to get things and changing seats. Everyone was joking about this other guy, Morris. Riley told a story about how she had once picked up a comb belonging to Morris, and it had broken in two, so she had bought him a new comb. She had felt that she was acting in a responsible and generous way, since she hadnt done anything to the first comb, it had just broken. But Morris hadnt accepted the new comb and said, angrily: I had that comb for fifteen years! Everything in this story, including the spontaneous rupture of the comb, was highly characteristic of Morris. Fifteen years ago you were three. You barely had hair, Riley said, addressing imaginary Morris. Maybe the comb is like the watch in Pulp Fiction, suggested Ivan. Oak, the child of hippies, stared at Ivan with his round blue insane-looking eyes, and said: My father had this comb up his ass for fifteen years! This new development, about Morriss father having the comb up his ass for fifteen years, was absorbed without further comment into the consensus. I admired Ivan for being able to contribute a joke close enough to the spirit of Riley and her friends to be assimilated in this way. Svetlanas housing block ended up having six Orthodox Jewish guys in it, because Svetlana had been in a Moral Reasoning section with the alpha Orthodox guy, Dave. The two had merged their blocks together, like a dynastic wedding. Dave was our age, but had a rich, chestnut-colored beard, and a voice like a radio announcers. He and Svetlana had been the two most outspoken people in their class, and had often continued their debates for hours, with what Svetlana called an almost sexual intensity. Svetlana said that she thought of herself as formed by classical thought as rediscovered by Christian people in the Renaissance, while Dave had a Talmudic system of interrogation and commentary, but they were able to meet on a certain plane, because their systems had a common origin in the Hebrew Bible. The Moral Reasoning class had been called If There Is No God, Then All Is Permitted. I didnt understand how people living in 1996 could have a huge debate about something like that. Someone whose only reason for not acting in an antisocial way was that they were scared of getting in trouble with God... where did you even start with such a person? Rileys system of patronage was less oppressive than Svetlanas, but also somehow less benevolent. Maybe you couldnt really be benevolent unless you were up in everyones business. Svetlana said her block was more nurturing, and my block was cooler; whereas proximity to such coolness would have prevented her, Svetlana, from being her authentic self, I didnt need as much nurturing. Was that true? Definitely, the word nurturing made my chest tighten. My block had been assigned to Mather, which was where the guys now lived: Oak, Ezra, Lucas, Morris, and some friendly geologists who were somehow attached to Oak. But Riley hated Mather so much that she got the rest of usme, Riley, Rileys premed classmate Priya, and Priyas roommate Joannetransferred to overflow housing. We still used the Mather facilities, but our rooms were in this other building: a red brick medium-rise full of two-bedroom units, with dishwashers, microwaves, garbage disposals, wall-to-wall carpet, and central heating. It was like an ordinary apartment building, except each bedroom had a metal bunk bed and two dorm-issue desks. I thought there was something spooky about the presence of a dormitory inside a building that seemed like normal people might live in it. Even in shopping week, accelerated Russian already met for the full two hours. Everyone complained, but I was secretly pleased. I didnt like when people acted as if nothing we did was time-sensitive. You have a lot of time, you dont need to be in a hurry. Thats what the deans said, when you tried to take five classes. Easy for them: they were already deans. Either that was something they wanted to be doing, in which case they could afford to relax; or it wasnt what they had wanted to be doing, and now they were invested in preventing anyone else from accomplishing anything, either. That had been the worst part of childhood: people telling you how lucky you were to live in a carefree time with no responsibilities. This was a point on which my mother and I had differed. She said that one of the most wonderful things about America was how children were allowed to be children, whereas in other countries, children had to become adults before they were ready; they were sexualized, or put to work. In America, childhood was a time to play and be innocent, to not have to make money or do anything that counted for anything. When I was little, whenever I heard of children who were distinguishing themselves in any field of art or science or sports, I was filled with longing and a deep sense of failure. But my mother viewed such prodigies with pity and sorrow: they hadnt been allowed to be children. After Russian, I had a meeting with Bob, my financial aid officer. As I was walking through the square, I felt a grown man trying to get my attention. Doom washed over me. He could only be asking for money. If I gave him anything, I was frivolously disposing of my mothers hard-won earningsjust to feel better about myself, in the eyes of some man. If I didnt give him anything, then I was a hypocrite, because I regularly used my moms money to buy stuff that I didnt really need, like seven-dollar pore-refining skin cleanser from CVS. I tried to pretend I didnt see him, but I could feel him trying harder, with a righteous energy that came from knowing that I had more money than him and that it wasnt fair. I gave up, and did what he was trying to force me to do: look at him. Then I saw that he was selling Real Change, the street paper, and felt relieved, because Real Change was technically a newspapera legitimate expenditureand was both cheaper and more interesting than other newspapers. I knew that my mother would have found it interesting, too. I love Real Change, I told the guy, giving him a dollar. He handed me the paper with a flourish. As I walked, I scanned the front page. The CONSPIRACY CORNER by John Doemy real name will be concealed for security reasonsdelighted me with its jaunty tone and abrupt ending: Anyway, Im off to go hide. Talk to you never! And why didnt more newspapers have a poetry section? The poems in Real Change were no worse, in any way that I could see, than the ones in the student literary magazine. Were the street people really good at poetry, or were we really bad? In We Masses Dont Want Tofu, tofu had been rhymed with opposed to. Another poem began: We live in a world where toddlers stake virgins. / Cuddling and cuteness are their diversions. Farther down, it turned out that the toddlers actually held some kind of elected office. I could cut that one out to make a collage for Riley. We had started making collages for each other and taping them to the bathroom mirror. In the waiting room at the financial aid office, I contemplated a poem called Hate. None of this to me seems real. I have no soul left to steal. My heart is now made of stone. Please dont leave me all alone. Was that poem good? It sounded like a Nine Inch Nails song. Was Nine Inch Nails good? I felt annoyed when people showed you a photograph of a urinal and tried to make you debate whether it was art. Nonetheless, I wanted to know whether a poem was good. Please dont leave me all alone. Was that what I, too, was afraid of? And maybe not just me, but everyone? I glanced around the waiting room, taking in various paintings of sailboats. The boy two chairs over from me was leaning down in his chair with his legs stretched out; his backpack had fallen over on the floor in front of him and looked like it had been shot. Something about the scene made me wonder whether that poem, and all the other poems, and the rest of the newspaper, and maybe other newspapers, were an expression of suffering that it was obscene to print and publish and distribute and read. Well, thats just it, I thought: you didnt just write down a raw cry of suffering. It would be boring and self-indulgent. You had to disguise it, turn it into art. Thats what literature was. That was what required talent, and made people want to read what you wrote, and then they would give you money. My financial aid officer, Bob, said that discrepancies involving my mothers reported assets were interfering with my federal loan eligibility. He showed me a credit report that said that my mother had taken out a mortgage on a home in Louisiana. The credit report seemed to be written in a way that was deliberately confusing, but eventually I understood what had happened: the reporting agency had confused my mother and my stepmother, who shared the same first name, and also the same last name. (My mother still used her married name, because it was on all her scientific papers.) My stepmothers middle name even started with the same letter as my mothers maiden name. Its kind of a funny coincidence, I said, because their name isnt actually that common. I mean its not a super-common Turkish name. Bob looked like he was in pain. So youre saying that Nurhan M. Karada and Nurhan M. Karada are two different people. I felt sorry for him. Every time I saw this guy, I ruined his day. I was already ineligible for any financial aid other than loans, because my parents combined income was more than a hundred thousand dollars. It didnt matter that they were in debt, having given all their money to lawyers during the custody suit when I was fourteen. My mother had eventually won the suit, on the condition that she move back to New Jersey. She sold her apartment at a loss, quit the job she loved in Philadelphia, and found a lower-paying position in Brooklyn, where she had to commute every day. We rented half a house in Essex County from two elderly Italian sisters who lived in the other half. It ended up being fun. Whenever the electricity or the gas was cut off, it felt like an adventure. My mother was sure I was going to become a great writer. Then I got into Harvard, like we had always wanted. My mom said that my getting in proved that she could have gotten in. Still, when Harvard said I wasnt eligible for financial aid, and another university offered me a full scholarship, I thought I should go there. My mother became furious and said I was always sabotaging myself. She was proud of being able to borrow money at a loss from her own retirement fund, and give it to Harvard. I felt proud of her, too. But I did not feel proud of myself. It made the college application process feel, in retrospect, somehow hurtful and insulting: all the essays and interviews and supplements and letters seemed to be about you, about your specialnessbut actually it was all about shaking your parents down for money. Harvard seemed really proud of its own attitude toward financial aid. You were always hearing about how merit-based aid, which was fine for other schools, didnt work here, where everyone was so full of merit. When your parents paid full tuition, part of what they were paying for was the benefit you derived from being exposed to people who were more diverse than you. My parents are paying for him to be here, so I can learn from him, my friend Leora said once, about a homeschooled guy from Arkansas in her history section who started talking about how the Jews killed Jesus. Leora had been my best friend when we were little, and then we went to different middle schools and high schools, but now we were at college together. She already thought every single person on earth was anti-Semitic, so she definitely hadnt learned anything from that guy. To me, the part of financial aid that made the least sense was that all the international students got full scholarships, regardless of how much money their parents had. The son of the prince of Nepal was in our class, and didnt pay tuition. Ivan had once caused me pain by saying something deprecating about people whose parents paid a hundred thousand dollars for them to be here. Did he not know that my parents were paying a hundred thousand dollars for me to be there? The thought that really made me crazy was that my parents had paid for Ivan to be there. It was another experience they had paid for me to have. I went to the student center to check email. Ivan still hadnt written. Today, I didnt feel that badly about it. He had been the last one to write, so wasnt it technically my turn to write to him? When I checked voice mail, I found a message from my mom, so I called her back at her lab. She answered on the second ring. I told her about the mix-up with Bob and Nurhan the Second. I thought she would think it was funny, but instead she sounded annoyed. I will speak to Bob, she said. I dont think you have to, I said. If they bother you again, let me know and Ill call them. They shouldnt be bothering you about this. My mother said she had gone to the doctor and wanted to ask me for my opinion. She said she had a minor issue, like a cyst. Either she could get surgery and have it removed and it would be gone, or she could do a non-surgical treatment and go back for check-ups every six months. I wasnt sure what my opinion could be based on, or what value it could have, since I wasnt a doctor, and she was. My mother said, a bit coldly, that she realized that I wasnt a physician, but that she had told me all the relevant information; she wasnt asking a medical question, but a question about personal preference. I understood I had said the wrong thing. I asked about how dangerous the surgery was, and what happened if you forgot to get one of the check-ups. She said the surgery needed general anesthesia, but it was a commonly performed procedure and wasnt considered high-risk. But you couldnt forget the check-ups; that was high-risk. I thought my mom already had too much stuff to remember, so I said I thought she should get the surgery and not bother with check-ups. Thats my feeling, too, my mother said in a warm voice. After we hung up, I realized that I now felt anxious about Ivan not having written. It was weird: nothing external had changed, but I felt differently. I ended up back at the computers, using the finger command, even though it always made me feel worse. Login name: ivanv In real life: Ivan Varga On since Tue Sep 3 10:24 (PDT) on pts/7 28 seconds Idle Time Mail last read Tue Sep 3 09:41 (PDT) Plan: Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law/ My services are bound. (KL I.ii.1-2) He was online, right now, looking into a screen just like I was. He had been sitting there thinking about something for twenty-eight seconds. And he had added a plan. I had learned from Riley what a plan was. It was a file where you could enter any text you wanted, and it would show up whenever someone fingered you. If you hadnt entered anything, it said No plan. Professors usually had No plan, because they didnt know how to change it, or didnt care. Grad students sometimes put their office hours. Freshmen sometimes put World domination or Taking over the universe. Otherwise, the most common thing to put was some kind of a quote or maxim. Rileys said: The quickest way to a mans heart is through his chest, with an axe. I didnt recognize Ivans quote, but assumed from the annoying-looking citation that it was from Shakespeare. Someone at MIT had put all Shakespeares plays online, and I found it in a soliloquy in King Lear. The last line was: Now, gods, stand up for bastards! Although I planned to read King Lear someday, I didnt feel like reading it right now, and anyway I didnt have time. I decided to stop by the liquor store where they sold CliffsNotes. In the liquor store, I learned that the soliloquy Thou, Nature, art my goddess was spoken by Edmund, the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester. Edmund, a Machiavellian character, rejected conventional morality, authority, and legitimacy, in favor of the law of nature. This involved a play on the term natural child, which also meant bastard. We didnt despise Edmund for plotting to usurp rightful power, because Shakespeare made Edmund speak directly to us, drawing us into his dangerous but exciting adventures, including his promiscuous sexual conquest of Goneril and Regan. Nothing I learned about Edmund made me feel better. Svetlana and I went to a lecture about Mrs.Dalloway and time. Apparently, Mrs.Dalloway illustrated a theory by Henri Bergson about two different kinds of time: the kind that could be measured by clocks, and another kind. At some point, a professor stood up and said in a tone of irritation that Virginia Woolf had never read Henri Bergson. The atmosphere in the room turned against the speaker, who said, lamely, that Woolf had once attended a public lecture by Bergson. Then a genial Italian-sounding man stood up and proposed that Bergsons ideas had been in the air. This utterance mended some tear in the social fabric to the extent that the talk could continuebut it was somehow clear, even to me, that what we were hearing was fanciful, ahistorical, and not rigorous. I felt outraged. So one writer hadnt read another writer: how was that proof that what they were saying wasnt related? Wasnt a theory of time more likely to be true if two people had come up with it independently? What kind of cretins cared more about hammering out a string of inheritance than about discovering universal truths? Historians, that was what kind. They would only be happy when they had translated every miraculous book into a product of its historical moment. Svetlana thought it made a miraculous book more miraculous to learn the writers historical influences: that way you could identify the miracle more precisely. To me, it seemed frivolous to waste time celebrating the circumstances under which someone had discovered some phenomenon. Wasnt it more important to try to apply the phenomenon to more different historical circumstances? In the end, Svetlana chose the major called History and Literature. But I didnt care about history so I chose the major that was just called Literature. The Second Week All the literature majors had to take a tutorial, where you read books and talked about them. My tutor, Judith, had a young face and white hair, and spoke in a knowing voice, occasionally bursting into high-pitched laughter. The subjects that most excited herhow Star Wars had the same narrative arc as The Iliad; how, if you looked up fix in the Oxford English Dictionary, the different definitions subverted each otherwhile not exactly uninteresting, were things I had nothing to say about. Once or twice, I made up some kind of opinion and said it anyway. It felt both boring and depressing. Most of the other people in my tutorial also said boring and depressing things. There were only two people, Allie and Jason, who ever said anything interesting. Allie had a New York accent and wore cat-eye eyeliner. Jason always looked mussed and half-asleep. I listened carefully to everything they said, to try to figure out what made it interesting. After tutorial, I went to the undergraduate library to try to read Either/Or. I stopped in front of the bookshelves in the foyer, where they displayed bound copies of all the senior honors theses that had won prizes last year. Mechanically I scanned the gold-lettered spines for Ivans name. When I found it, it felt like a dream. The name I thought about all the time, but never saidembossed on a library bindingas if there was already a book about it. I took the thesis down from the shelf. It was really thin, like all the math theses. To my surprise, it started with a story. A girl and her parents are visiting the Museum of Very Modern Art. In the Cubism exhibit, the little girl wanders away and starts taking a random walk in three dimensions. How many rooms will she pass through before she finds her parents again? The rest of the thesis was symbols and equations. I replaced it on the shelf, wondering why I had such an uneasy feeling. Was it just the effect of seeing something Ivan had written that had nothing to do with me, and that I hadnt known about? The idea of a person finding their parents again, by random chance, felt like a Greek tragedy. And why was it a little girl? What was it with girlswhy was he so interested? I realized that I envied herbecause of her curiosity and fearlessness, and because Ivan had written a whole book about her. I wondered if anything I wrote would ever become a library book, with my name in gold letters. I usually skipped introductions, but I read the one in Either/Or, just to figure out what kind of book it was. Though classified as philosophy, it had different narrators, like a novel, and had originally been published as two volumes: the collected papers of A, who lived aesthetically, and B, who lived ethically. The papers, which had supposedly been found in an old desk, included essays, aphorisms, sermons, letters, music criticism, a play, and the novella The Seducers Diary, attributed to As friend, Johannes. According to the introduction, lots of people skipped the ethical half, and even most of the aesthetic half, and just read The Seducers Diary. Kierkegaard himself had said of Either/Or that you had to either read the whole book, or just not read it at all. Kierkegaard was funny! Nonetheless, I too flipped forward to The Seducers Diary. It started with a description of Johannes, the seducerabout how he was able, using his mental gifts, to make a girl fall in love with him, without caring to possess her in any stricter sense: I can imagine him able to bring a girl to the point where he was sure she would sacrifice all, but when matters had come that far he left off without the slightest advance having been made on his part, and without a word having been let fall of love, let alone a declaration, a promise. Yet it would have happened, and the unhappy girl would retain the consciousness of it with double bitterness... she would constantly have to contend with the doubt that the whole thing might only have been imagination. When I read that, I almost threw up. Wasnt that what had happened to me? Hadnt I been brought to the point where I would sacrifice everythingonly for him to leave off without the slightest advance having been made? Wasnt I always asking myselfhadnt other people, including a psychologist at the student center, repeatedly asked mewhether the whole thing was in my imagination? As soon as she wanted to speak of it to another, Kierkegaard wrote, it was nothing. The extent to which he left a girl with nothing was the very mark of his artistry. It meant having the self-control to not get her pregnant or abandon her at the altar. It meant no spectators, no proof. The more I read, the more parallels I found to my own experience. The emails Ivan and I had exchanged, which had felt like something new we had invented, now seemed to have been following some kind of playbook. The seducer explained the importance of alternating between anguished or ambiguous love letters and ironic in-person meetings. In person, you could never explicitly mention the letters, or say, Did you get my letter, but you had to always be alluding to them, reinforcing or undercutting their message. The reason he had such good techniques, the seducer explained, was because he had learned them from the best teachers: young girls themselves. The idea that Ivan could have written letters with other girlsthat he could have done that whole thing before, multiple times, on purposewas new, painful, and baffling. At five I had to go back to the literature department to watch The Usual Suspects. It was for tutorial, for a unit on genre theory. Kevin Spacey, that bland-looking man who always played sociopaths, apparently used genre theory to trick the detective into thinking he was a small-time crook who had been duped by a Turkish master criminal. The Turkish master criminalwhose name, Keyser Sze, was not an actual Turkish namehad murdered his own family, and also the families of some Hungarians. Selin, was that what your summer was like? asked Jason. Yeah, its an exact transcript, I said. I guess they had a secret camera. At the end of the movie, Kevin Spacey limped out of the detectives office, seemingly broken by the discovery of how he had been manipulated by Keyser Sze. Then, the detective noticed that the bulletin board in his office was manufactured by a company called Quartet, in Skokie, Illinois. Kevin Spaceys story had involved a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois. Looking around the room, the detective recognized more words and details from Kevin Spaceys story. In this way, he understood that the story had been false, and that Kevin Spacey himself was Keyser Sze. The sense of discovering a total deception, in the absence of the person who had created it; the fact that the deception itself was specially tailored for one other person, using words that seemed meaningful but had actually occurred randomly in the environment; the confusing fact that the random words in the environment thus did have a special meaning, though they got it somehow retrospectively: all rose in my chest and prevented me from breathing. Someone turned on the lights. The VCR machine started shrieking as it reverse-digested the tape. Jason and Allie were talking about whether something had been exploitative. It sounded interesting, but I couldnt concentrate. After a while I stood up and left without saying anything, as if I was just going to the bathroom. I went downstairs and sat in an empty classroom, remembering one thing after another that Ivan had written or said, things that hadnt seemed important at the time. Once, he had told me that strawberries grew on trees. I had contradicted him, citing my memory of an actual strawberry plant I had seen onceand yet, when he had held his ground, I had backed down: it hadnt seemed important, and my memory itself hadnt seemed to prove anything. Youre easy to convince, he had said. I was wondering when you were going to stop me, he had said, another time. I was wondering how long you would let me keep going. I felt the same horror I had felt when I was reading Kierkegaardthe same sense that Ivans actions had been following a playbook that I hadnt known existed. However I felt right now, had Ivan planned for me to feel that way? The thought was terrifying but somehow sexually magnetic. In the Quincy dining hall, the meal service was over, but almost half the tables were still occupied. Svetlana had seen me and was waving. She was methodically making her way through a plate of cottage cheese and raw vegetables. This was a new development. She said it wasnt a diet, because the idea wasnt to diminish herself, but, rather, to reveal her real, stronger body. I was still the kind of person who thought it was interesting to see what happened if you only ate cashews for a week. Svetlana and her roommates were talking about a junior on their floor who had been named one of Glamour magazines top ten promising college women and who, in addition to having perfect classical features, a sexy mole, and lustrous hair, was the co-author of three peer-reviewed papers on genetics, ran a science program for underprivileged teens, vice-chaired a committee on intercultural and race relations, and held a black belt in tai chi. It was objected that it wasnt possible to have a black belt in tai chi. If anyone could have one, it would be Ayesha, Svetlana said. I had been hoping to talk to Svetlana about Kierkegaard and The Usual Suspects, but she and her roommates were going to their friend Patiences birthday party. Everyone had chipped in for a cake that Svetlana wasnt going to eat. Why dont you come? Svetlana said, and Valerie added, You should come! You can eat Svetlanas cake! Svetlanas roommates really were nice. But there was no way I was going to that birthday party. Late at night, I wrote Ivan an email listing everything he had done that I didnt understand. I put in all the contradictions and the things that seemed like liesso he could defend himself, like he had said. It came out really long. By the time I got to breakfast the next morning, Svetlana was already almost done with her yogurt. I barely had time to gulp down half a bowl of Cracklin Oat Branthe most filling cereal, in almost a sinister waybefore she made us leave for Russian. We were the first people there. At first it seemed like I might have time to tell her about Kierkegaard, but I had barely gotten started when our classmate Gavriil came in. Gavriil had a wiry build and fluffy hair resembling that of Mozart in the movie Amadeus, and was always climbing things. You might look at a library or a church and see something on the wall, and it would be that guy, Gavriil. Check it out, Gavriil said, proudly unzipping his backpack. It was full of broccoli and cabbage. Looks like you have some healthful vegetables there, Svetlana said. Lets just say they fell off the back of a truck, he said, zipping the bag and depositing it on the floor. So hows it going? Selin could be better, Svetlana said. Oh? Who do I have to beat up? Svetlana rolled her eyes. Hes much bigger than you, and hes in California. Wait, its really a guy? Do I know him? He was in our Russian class part of last year, Svetlana said. Remember that really tall guy, Ivan? Oh, yeah, the guy nobody ever talked to! Hes Hungarian. I talked to him once. He was really nice. Well, Selin talked to him too, and then he terrorized her with ambiguous emails about sex, even though he already had a girlfriend, and led her on a wild-goose chase to a Hungarian village, and then he disappeared, and now he wont talk to her. Really? Gavriil looked impressed. Not exactly, I said, at the same time as Svetlana said, Yes. Gavriil furrowed his brows. Do you think he went through a process of ideological formation under the Warsaw Pact? Do you think he was specially created to destroy women? Like they send him to the West to meet women who might have become famous engineers or professors, but they dont, because of him? That must be really comforting for Selin, Svetlana said. Im going to become whatever I was going to become, I said. Oh definitely, you got out of it in time, Gavriil said, looking satisfied. He tipped his chair back against the wall, leaning his feet on the backpack full of stolen vegetables. I couldnt talk to Svetlana after class, because I had a lunch meeting with Peter and the other English teachers from the Hungary program. Peter had set the date in July, in the town square in Eger: noon, the second Wednesday of September, outside the Science Center. I got there a few minutes early and went inside to check my email at a terminal. There was a new message from Ivan. In response to everything I had written, he had composed a poem. It was a truly awful poemway worse than the ones in Real Change. Lets eat some dirty strawberries rhymed with This psychologist is smart, Im just a mass of dishonesties. I dont love you, you hate me. Come dance with me again. Writer queen whom I admire, fallen analystI logged out, my heart pounding. He hadnt refuted anything, or reassured me about anything. Was he saying I was right? The English teachers were standing in the sun. Everyone looked a little bit different than I remembered, especially their hair. Peter turned up with a girl I had never seen before, from his Korean program. She was wearing perfect neutral makeup and kept talking about the genius of Johannes Kepler. Thats the genius of Johannes Kepler, she said, more than once. We went to a Spanish restaurant. Peter ordered sangria for the table. Nobody checked ID. Whatever happened to Ivan? asked the girl who loved Kepler. I never see him anymore. He graduated, Peter said. He went out to California. Does he have a new email address? He must, Peter said, and looked at me. I studiously fished an apple slice out of my sangria. Everyone else was talking about how some guy had brained a feral dog with a rock in Romania. I will definitely find out and let you know, Peter told the girl. Afterward, we all walked back toward campus. The world looked particularly crisp and etched-out in the sunlight. I became aware of Peter walking in step with me. Hey, Selin, he said. Hows it going. Fine, I said. How are you? Oh, excellent. Classes going OK? Yeah. Splendid. Selin, I have a quick question for you. Would you happen to know Ivans new email address at Berkeley? I didnt really want to tell him, but there didnt seem to be any other option. He spelled it back, to make sure hed gotten it right. You know, Ivan and I have been out of touch lately, he said. Hows he doing anyway? I dont know, I said. Oh, you havent heard from him since the summer either? Well... he didnt say how he was doing. But we do know at least hes alive and breathing. Right, I said, unable to return his smile. Whats the deal with Ivan? I blurted, without having meant to. Whats... the deal? Is he... an evil person? A series of expressions passed over Peters face. I could see right away that he wasnt going to say anything useful. Never mind, I said. Some people say he is, Peter said. I felt my heart pounding. They do? I suppose you ran into Zita. Sorry? Zita is going through a difficult time right now, Peter said, in a careful, quiet tone, like somebody explaining racism to a child. Theres a lot going on. She isnt seeing things clearly. Shes saying things she doesnt really mean. Ivans ex-girlfriends may badmouth him, but they would take him back in a heartbeat. Everything went black. So I was part of a larger group of ex-girlfriends: girls who had never gotten, would never get, over him. Worse than that: I wasnt even an ex-girlfriend. I didnt have the dignity of having once been a girlfriend. I gradually became aware of Peter, who seemed to be waiting for me to say something. Please forget I said anything. I dont know who Zita is. Nobody said anything bad about Ivan to me. This isnt coming from Zita? I literally dont know who that is. Then where is it coming from? I felt a pang of irritation. My own life experiences. There was a pause. And what experiences were these? Peter asked, in a gentler voice. Well, there were kind of a lot of them. Perhaps I can help elucidate. I glanced at his faceat his concerned, adult expression. I meant to tell him to forget it, but instead I heard myself say: He didnt tell me about his girlfriend. He didnt tell you about Zita? He didnt tell me about his current girlfriend. Eunice? He didnt tell you about Eunice? I think it was a misunderstanding. Peter was quiet for a moment. Ivan does strange things sometimes, but hes a good person. I really believe that. If theres a misunderstanding, you should talk to him about it. I know he really cares about you. Hes told me so. You should let him explain. I could hear the creaking sound behind my eyes that meant tears were forming. Feeling unable to walk, I sat on a rock and stared at the advice column of Real Change. Three different people, Carol, Rich, and Tammi, answered all the letters, often contradicting each other. There is no hard-and-fast rule, Carol told Single in Somerville, who had a one-year-old son, and wanted to know when to start dating again. It was unclear whether she wanted to start dating, or whether she viewed it as some kind of requirement. Rich thought that Singles one-year-old son deserved a male role model, but only as long as Single was prepared for a mature relationship. Tammis advice was: Honestly you have to put yourself out there, or you will never move on. The next letter writer, Riled by Rumors, had an issue with people who wouldnt keep their noses and mouths in their own business. Half of these are people I have never even done anything to, Riled wrote. The only reason they dont like me is because of rumors they heard. Rumors always occur, Carol observed, with her typical lack of content. If you want to stop them, there is no proven way. Avoid other people and tell them to avoid you, Rich advised. If that doesnt work, reluctantly resort to physical violence. According to Tammi, the best way to stop rumors was to keep your mouth shut. You say that half of these are people youve never even done anything to, and that they dont like you because of rumors. Well, I dont like you already, and Ive never even met you. Why wasnt I better at keeping my mouth shut? I knew Peter would tell Ivan what I had said. The actual diary part of The Seducers Diary started on April 4. The seducer saw a seventeen-year-old girl go into a department store. He followed her around, trying to figure out who she was and how he could meet her. He basically kept stalking her for all of April. By May 5, the seducer still hadnt managed to learn the girls name, and started railing against chance. (Damned chance! I am waiting for you. I do not wish to defeat you with principles....) He talked about being worthy of serving chanceworthy of being a servant. Ivan, too, had expressed rhetorical anger at abstract concepts, and seemed to think in terms of being worthy and unworthy. The way the guy was sort of bragging about being both a colleague and a servant of chance reminded me of that line in King Lear. It occurred to me to wonder whether nature was my goddess. Somehow I felt like she wasnt. On May 19, the seducer finally found out the girls name: Cordelia, like the third of King Lears daughters. (Waitso King Lear was part of it?) Cordelias father, a naval captain, had been strict. Now, both her parents were dead. She lived alone with her paternal aunt. It occurred to me that I, too, had once lived alone with my paternal aunt, for a couple of months during the custody suit. She has, then, some conception of lifes pains, of its darker side, the seducer wrote. But how did he know? Wasnt it possible that none of it had really bothered her? The seducer said it was good that Cordelia had suffered so early in life. On the one hand, her womanliness was still intact, and she wasnt crippled. On the other, the fact that she had suffered could be useful to him. (Had my family background been useful to Ivan?) The seducer also noted with approval that Cordelia had always been alone. Isolation, though detrimental for a young man, was essential for a girl. This was because a girl should not be interesting. The seducer didnt explain the connection between being isolated and being uninteresting, remarking only: A young girl who wants to please by being interesting really only succeeds in pleasing herself. All my effort to be interesting: was that, too, something I had to be ashamed of? Her father and mother had not lived happily together; what usually beckons, more or less clearly or vaguely, to a young girl does not beckon to her. That was true of me, as well: both the part about my parents not living happily together, and the part about what beckoned to other girlsto Svetlana, for instancenot beckoning to me. Were the two things connected? Although she is quiet and modest, undemanding, there is an immense demand lying there unconsciously: why was that line so exciting, and so troubling? The seducer went on to say that he couldnt let Cordelia rest on him too heavily, like a burden. She had to be so light that he could take her on his arm. I immediately felt that I had rested on Ivan too heavily, like a burden. I wondered whether I had to go on a diet, like Svetlana was doing, even if she didnt call it that. Of course, I knew he meant light figuratively. But didnt he also mean it literally? You couldnt imagine Cordelia being fat. When the seducer proposed marriage, he did it as confusingly as possible, so that Cordelia would have no idea what she had agreed to: If she can predict anything, then I have gone wrong and the whole relationship loses its meaning. It was just how I had felt, going to Hungary. Once they were engaged, he put on a whole campaign to persuade Cordelia that engagements were dumb, and got her to break it off. It had to be her decision, because he was too proud to vulgarly deceive a girl with false promises. He also looked down on raping people, and thought it was unaesthetic to use money, power, influence, sleeping draughts, and so on. And yet, wasnt he using money and power? He had servants and stagecoaches and all kinds of diversionswhile Cordelia was stuck in that house with her aunt. After Cordelia broke off the engagement, she was sent to the country to stay with a family. The seducer sent her anguished letters, while secretly preparing a house where he micromanaged every detail: the views from the windows, the furniture and layout of the rooms, the music that lay open on the piano. Why cant a night like that be longer? the seducer wrote, in the final diary entry, after they spent their first and last night together. He left before she woke upbecause of how disgusted he was by womens tears and prayers, which change everything yet are really of no consequence. I thought about that a lot: about what she could have said that would have been of consequence. What to make of this chilling tale? Clearly, it wasnt true. Kierkegaard hadnt done those things, and didnt believe in them. He had made them up, to illustrate an impossibly villainous person. How was it, then, that The Seducers Diary corresponded so closely to what felt like the most meaningful thing that had ever happened to me? Was there a way of viewing Cordelias situation as not bad, or as bad for only historically contingent reasons? Cordelia had lived in the nineteenth century, and couldnt go to college or have an interesting job, so she had to get married. But I didnt want to get marriednot even to Ivan. It was true that I had daydreamed about taking his nameabout having a new nameabout feeling chosen and special. The phrase have his babylike in the Alanis Morissette song, where she said Would she have your babywas electrifying: to think of being weighted in that way, by him. But the thought of having an actual baby, like my aunts and my stepmother, was the opposite of electrifying. Was there a version of The Seducers Diary where they were equalwhere he wasnt tricking her into doing something she didnt want? Or was that what seduction was? When Svetlana came to pick me up at my suite, Priya was passing through the common room wearing a floaty dress. I just wonder how much of wanderlust is just regular lust, she was saying into the cordless phone. We exchanged waves as she drifted into her bedroom. Priya was a year younger than the rest of us, spoke in a lilting voice, and was so cartoonishly beautiful that you had to keep staring at her to be sure she was real. Whos the apparition of beauty? Svetlana asked afterward, in the stairwell. Thats Priya, I said. Rileys friend. Riley has friends, other than those guys? Whats her deal? Well, I dont rightly know. Svetlana nodded. She probably cant have a strong personality because of her appearance. I dont mean only that she doesnt need one. Whatever personality she did have would end up being incidental to her beauty, so it couldnt be strong. I almost feel sorry for her, but I dont, because she doesnt seem sorry, and because she must go through life surrounded by a cushion of love. Everyone loves to be near beauty. Even Riley, who is so critical, isnt immune to it. I told Svetlana everything I had thought about after watching Usual Suspects and reading Kierkegaard. It took a long time. At some point, I noticed Svetlanas expression. What, I said. I was just suddenly so glad I wasnt you, she said. Im sorry if that sounds mean. I used to envy your situation last year, but now I dont anymore. She seemed to be growing smaller, like I was looking at her from the bottom of a deep pit. Oh, I said. I just really think you should be seeing someone, Svetlana said. This was an unforeseen level of perfidy. Seeing someone was how people talked about having a boyfriendabout having a relationship that wasnt all in your headabout being healthy and self-respecting enough to be with someone who really cared about you. I mean a therapist, she said. And, when she saw my expression: I think you arent seeing things clearly. How was a therapist going to help me see things more clearly, when he didnt know any of these people, and couldnt know anything other than what was told to him, by me: a person who apparently didnt see things clearly? The first time I talked to a psychologist was when I was fourteen. The judge in the custody suit had decided that we all had to be psychologically evaluated: me, my parents, my stepmother, my aunts, even my mothers new boyfriend, who was identified in the records as Paramour of the mother. The lawyers said that the judge seemed to be going out of his way to prolong the case. Some people in my family said it was because the judge was Greek, but I thought it was wrong to believe in something so prejudiced. Everyone had been assigned to a different psychologist. Mine talked in a little-girl voice, and told me that when she thought of Turkey she imagined camels, and asked if I had to wear a veil when we went there. Sensing how hurt my mother would have been if she had heard those questions, I did my best to explain to the social worker how important secularism and science were in the Turkish national identity. I went to three or four such meetings, at night, after I got off the bus from cross-country practice. I nearly wept from fatigue and annoyance. But the worst part was after it seemed to be over, when the psychologists wrote up reports of what we had all said, and circulated them to everyone involved. I hadnt known that everything we said would be circulated to everyone else. I learned a lot from that, like how much it hurt to see how other people described you, and how things that you said about another person, especially your parents, seemed neutral when addressed to a third party, but lethal when you thought about your parents reading it. Last year, when I almost got a C in Russian, I had tried talking to a psychologist at the student health center. He became visibly impatient whenever I mentioned Ivan, who was the reason I had gone there in the first place. All he wanted to talk about was my parents divorce. Like all adults, he thought everything was always about my parentsabout how I was affected by them, or reacting to them. When I persisted in talking about Ivan, the psychologist said that I was in an imaginary relationship with an unavailable person, because I was afraid to be in a real relationship with an available person. This struck me as a statement devoid of meaning. What available person was he talking about? Where was that person? He didnt answer and only sat there, his left hand holding his right in a way that displayed his wedding band, in case I had missed the photo on his bookshelf. Obviously I knew that Ivan wasnt available. That was how he, the therapist, knew it: because I had just told him. Obviously I knew that my position was humiliating. I didnt need some underachiever with a masters degree to tell me how my problem was that nobody loved me the way he loved his defeated conformist-looking wife. Svetlana said that being evaluated by court psychologists didnt count as trying therapy, and neither did going once to the student health center. Therapy didnt work unless you found the right person, and went lots of times. She said she would ask her therapist to write me a referral. I recognized this mania for referrals from people our parents age: the way they thought that the most difficult problems could only be solved by special insider information that you had coaxed out of some guy with a name like Chuck. From everything I knew about Svetlanas therapist, he was just the kind of jocular Socratic advice-implier I didnt want to hear from. Svetlana had once told me, as if it was a funny story, about the time when he had asked her why she didnt have pierced ears, and she had explained that she didnt want to be punctured, considering it a violation of her bodily integrity. Her therapist started laughing, and then she laughed, too, because she realized she had been talking about her fear of sex. All I needed was some grown man guffawing at me about sex. Furthermore, I knew that Svetlana paid her therapist, on top of what the insurance covered, because he wasnt at the student health center. For her, it wasnt a big deal, because her parents always sent her more money than she knew what to do with. But I didnt want to ask my parents for more money. Anyway, how could therapy even work on me, when I was so far from sharing Svetlanas therapist-like belief that people should be healthy and well-adjusted, that they should go to bed at the same time every night, even if they were reading or having an interesting conversation, or that it was great and life-affirming to go hiking with some guy, or to get married? Of course therapy worked for someone who believed those things. Furthermore, Svetlana had actual psychological problems, like post-traumatic stress from the war in Yugoslavia. I hadnt been in a war, or had to leave the country. Everything had been rearranged so that I would stay in the same place. Nobody in my family had ever given me diet pills: something that had also befallen Svetlana. For Svetlana, therapy was a good solution, but my case was completely different. Whatever problems I had were of my own makingand that meant I was going to have to solve them myself. Some Things Svetlana and I Talked About What was an orgy like? I thought slow and languorous; Svetlana thought fast and frenetic. Nobody would know who was who. What was charisma: a content or a form? (We talked a lot about whether different things were a content or a form.) We thought charisma was probably more like a form: less a matter of saying or doing particular charismatic things, than of saying or doing things in a charismatic way. We discussed which of the people we knew had charisma, whether it could be acquired, whether it was desirable. Svetlana said that she used to have it, but got freaked out by how much she enjoyed it, and forced herself not to have it. She thought I had it in a specific way but pretended not to have it. Were we really more interesting than other people, or did we only seem that way to ourselves? I thought that we only seemed more interesting to ourselves. A corollary of this belief was that we had no particular responsibility to think about other people. They found themselves interesting, they could think about themselves. Svetlana thought that we really were more interesting, and thus had certain responsibilities. Was an equal relationship possible, or did one person always like the other person more? Which of us, me or Svetlana, liked the other more? I feel like its different at different times, I said. Svetlana said she agreed. Could friendships reach a stable point and stay there, or were they always either growing or shrinking? Svetlana thought they grew and shrank. What was the worst cruelty: personal or political? Svetlana thought political: denying a persons personhood and turning them into a number. I thought it was just as bad to be tormented to death by a relative or a landlord as to be shot in a death camp. Was every smart person funny? I thought humorlessness was the essence of stupidity. Svetlana thought she knew some genuinely smart people who happened not to be interested in whether things were funny. We agreed that Susan Sontag was not funny. The quality of knowing what one wanted and how to get it: Svetlana had it more than I did, but the person who had it the most was this girl Misty who sang in operas and was a Mormon. What was more pure: vocal or instrumental music? Svetlana said vocal, because everything else was an imitation of the human voice. I thought instrumental, because a violin had more range and fewer limitations than a persons voice. Was it necessary to be cruel to be great or a genius or an effective person? I said no. Svetlana said yes. She said you had to have an edge. She implied that I was tricking myself or being hypocritical, if I thought I disagreed. I felt uneasily flattered. What is style, what is taste; how do you develop a style, how do you develop a taste? Who that we knew had one, how did they get it? In Paris we had stayed for a few days in an apartment belonging to this girl Jeanne, the daughter of Svetlanas friends familys friend. Jeanne was staying with her boyfriend the whole time, so we never met her. Everything about her apartmentthe chunky ashtrays and stacked Cahiers du Cinma, the low Japanese-looking double bed, the kitchen with its aperitif bottles and espresso machineall conveyed a level and granularity of style that we could not aspire to, living, as we did, in dormitories full of institutionalized furniture and schoolbooks. I find this apartment very intimidating, Svetlana had said, voicing what we had both been thinking. Jeanne is only twenty but she already has a taste. What makes you say that? Svetlanas friend Bill had said. The fact that she has a boyfriend and you dont? I knew that he had brought up her lack of a boyfriend to make her feel bad, because a few sentences earlier she had upset him by using a word he didnt know. And yet, I felt in some sense that he was right: that the thing that intimidated us, a style, a taste, was related to having a boyfriend. Was that why Svetlana put up with Billwhy boors, in general, were widely tolerated and promoted to high social positions: because they accurately gauged and reflected the way of the world? Or did the boors determine the ways of the world, from the positions they were put into? Was there another way things could be? Or was it, to use one of the boors favorite phrases, cognitively hardwired? I couldnt really ask Svetlana; whenever I criticized Bill in any detail, she started defending him and listing good things he had supposedly done that I didnt know about. Was a style what you needed to make someone fall in love with you? The other subject we talked about was whether men were less affected by love than womenwhether they suffered less from heartbreak. Even if suffering was, as Svetlana insisted, universally human, and thus also befell men, it seemed inarguable that men were better at compartmentalizing, and less easily distracted from their intellectual goals. Was this because their neurological hardwiring made them better at systems, while women were better at empathybecause men valued abilities and things, while women valued feelings and people? How could we learn to place less value on feelings and people? Svetlana liked to think of exceptions: cases of men whose hearts had been broken by women, who couldnt forget the women, even though the women could forget. I felt obliged to mention that it had been my mother who had left my father, and my father had been really upset and had cried. On the other hand, my mother had left because she thought she had always loved my father more than he loved her, and, before she left, she had been the one who cried. Furthermore, my father had soon remarried and became cheerful again, while my mothers boyfriend caused her suffering. Svetlana brought up our friend Jeremy, a philosophy major, who was in love with two different girls named Diane, neither of whom loved him. But even though he talked about the Dianes constantly, he didnt seem incapacitated; he always had the strength to pivot to his other favorite topic, which was the works of Thomas Pynchon. You couldnt imagine him unable to stop crying. Was it possible that he was protected somehow by the fact that there were two of them? Our other friend, Chris, did seem to become incapacitated by lovebut Chris was gay, and that somehow made it different. Svetlana pointed out that Young Werther, who was not gay, had killed himself for love. Furthermore, after Goethe wrote about Werther, lovesick youths all over Europe also started killing themselves. The Sorrows of Young Werther was shorter than I had expected, under a hundred pages, and mostly in letters. I sat on one of those round step stools at the bookstore and skimmed just the parts about Werthers love life. I realized, as I read, that I had wanted the girl to turn out to be less interested in Young Werther than in her own goals and activities, and for that to be why he had to kill himself. This was not the case. In fact, the girl, Charlotte, had no goals or activities, other than nursing sick people. You never found out if she even liked Werther, because she had already promised her sick mother that she would marry some other guy, and because she was virtuous, meaning that Werther himself didnt expect or want her to change her mind. Werther decided that the only way forward was for someone to die: either him, Charlotte, or the other guy. Because murder went against his moral code, he opted for suicide. First, he tricked Charlotte into giving him pistols, so he could say he was dying by her hand. Then, he did such a crappy job of shooting himself that everyone had to watch him spurting blood for twelve hours. That part was narrated by an editor, because Werther couldnt write it himself. The last lines were: Charlottes life was despaired of. The body was carried by laborers. No priest attended. It sounded to me as if Werthers suicide was less an expression of a rejection-induced loss of self-worth or cognitive capacity, than a practical work-around to his no murder rule. His self-worth had never been on the line. He hadnt been rejected, after careful consideration, on account of having an insufficiently impressive soul. For this reason, I didnt count The Sorrows of Young Werther as a book about how men were just as incapacitated by heartbreak as women. The Third Week Almost overnight, the weather stopped feeling like summer. I was able to wear the new boots I had bought over the summer at the Payless across from Penn Station. Zip-up, chestnut-colored, with block heels, they not only came in womens eleven but ran large enough that they fit onto my feet, which were size eleven and a half: a conceptual category that was rarely realized, since half-sizes stopped at ten, in the form of any actual shoes. It felt exciting to wear shoes that werent unisexthe way they rang out on the stones. Because a Diet Coke can had exploded in my backpack, I also had a new bag: a canvas army surplus bag, with a shoulder strap. It made me feel grown-up and jaunty, the way it hit below my hip, and it wasnt a huge production to get things out, like it was from a backpack. If I happened to be carrying an object that felt talismanic, like my copy of Either/Or, I could feel it close at hand. The Chance professor was wearing an expensive-looking shapeless dress with a collar that stood up like the mouth of a vase. I didnt understand everything she was saying, but every now and then a sentence jumped out and seemed to sparkle midair. What was the role of chance in literature? The realist novel was predicated on the contingency of everyday life, laying out in its opening pages the accidents of the characters birth to a particular historical, geographic, and social milieu. Characters were no longer allegorical, or social types. They were doomed to have personalities. Balzac called chance the greatest novelist in the world. How was one to be so artful that the end product seemed to be free of art? The social novel gave meaning to chance events, by embedding them in a historical order. Baudelaire wrote something about flneurs, and Walter Benjamin wrote something about Baudelaire. The flneur on his walk both observed and constituted urban life. This was Hegelian. Freud, Darwin, and Conan Doyle elevated chance to a new status. Dreams, fossils, clues: all were the accretions of chance, randomly piled up, like the cigar ashes that only Sherlock Holmes could parse. Prousts narrator couldnt write his book until a chance encounter with a specific kind of cookie. Andr Breton, a Surrealist, not only documented but provoked coincidences, viewing them as the royal road to the unconscious: thats what Freud called dreams. Louis Aragon described Paris as a palimpsest of chance encounters. Of Aragons volume about Paris, Walter Benjamin said: Evenings in bed I could not read more than a few words of it before my heartbeat got so strong I had to put the book down. At that point in the lecture, I felt too excited to sit still, so I left, trying not to make any noise. At dinner, I explained how I had gone to a literature class where the professor had read a quote from Walter Benjamin about how he could only read a few words of a book by Louis Aragon before he got too excited to read any more, and that then I myself had gotten so excited that I had to leave the lecture. What class was that? The Literature of Short Attention Spans? Lucas asked. Im pretty sure I already took that, Oak said thoughtfully. Several times. In the kitchen of our suite, I noticed a dark-colored cord draped over the edge of the sink. On inspection, it proved to be the tail of a square aquatic creature with eyes in the top of its head. It was big and flat, taking up nearly the whole basin, and resembled a flag that had been made out of a shark. Scanning the environment for some sign as to why it was there, I noticed KC, a member of the Singaporean club, sitting at the heavy round oak table that our block had voted to steal from an atrium somewhere, where we thought it looked neglected. Lucas and Oak had just picked it up and carried it down the street, and nobody had stopped them. Hey, KC, I said. Hey, she said, barely looking up from her book. So... whos that in the sink? Its a stingray. Several questions came to my mind, like whose stingray it was, why it was in the sink, how KC had gotten into our apartment, and where Joanne was. On reflection, though, I realized none of these things was actually a problem for me, so I just went to the library. I tried to read the rest of Either/Or, but nothing in it felt as meaningful as The Seducers Diary. The ethical half, the one written by the judge, was not only more boring than the aesthetic half, but it also made less sense. In the first letter, titled The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage, the judge tried to prove that a series of love affairs was objectively less interesting than one long painful boring marriage. The last time I had read anything talking up marriage like that had been the report of my fathers meetings with the court psychologist, where I first saw the phrase nuclear family. My father had talked about the stabilizing influence of the nuclear family, which my mother couldnt offer, but he could, because he had gotten remarried, and my stepmother had gotten pregnant. My father said that he had done those things for me. But it wasnt clear to me how I immediately benefited. The dog had disappeared, as had all my mothers plates and towels, and my paternal aunt. The plates and towels were replaced by plates and towels with gold trim. Thenceforth, on drives, I sat in the back, with the baby. My father periodically looked in the rearview mirror and asked, Hows it going back there? I tried my hardest to smile, knowing that, when I couldnt, I was going on the record as a sulky, difficult teenor, worse yet, jealous of my father, of his attention. By the time I got to dinner, I could see only two empty seats in the dining hall. The first was directly across from one of the house tutors: a grown man who, having attended Dalton, always asked what high school you had gone to, in the hope that it had been Dalton. The other seat was across from a blond cherubic-looking guy with a laptop. He was eating toast, and looked identical to Ivans unpleasant friend, Imre. Imre had graduated and was supposed to be at Caltech, so probably it wasnt him. Even if it was him, though, I decided I would still rather sit there than across from the Dalton guy. Is it OK if I sit here? I asked, in what came out as kind of an angry voice, setting my tray on the table. Ye-es, the blond guy said, pushing aside his computer. His eyes were a shockingly pale blue that I had never seen before. Sorry, I think I thought you were someone else, I said. We havent met before, right? No. But we can meet now. His excessively correct posture and intonation, together with the slight lag in his replies, contributed to the impression that he was responding to directions that were being beamed to him from a great distance. He asked where the name Selin was from. It was a question I had to answer ten times every day, and yet, coming from this guy, who had such unusual mannerisms and who gave his own name as Juho, it didnt really bother me. Its Turkish, I said. What about Juho? Can you guess? Oh, wow. Um. Probably not. You could try, though. Greenland, I said, realizing, as I said it, that he was wearing an emerald-green sweatshirt and matching emerald-green pants. He sat up even straighter than he had been. This is a very surprising guess, he said. Greenland has the lowest population density of the world. Even the Sahara is more densely populated than Greenland. The probability that I am from Greenland is very small. If you have to guess someones nationality in the future, Greenland should probably be your last guess. I looked at him closely, trying to judge if he was some kind of asshole. I hadnt even wanted to guess his nationality. Iceland, I said. That is warmer, not just because Iceland is warmer than Greenland, but because it is closer to where I am from. Oh. Cool. I turned my attention to a bread bowl of Yankee bean soup. I was done trying to guess where this guy was from. I will give you a hint, he said. In my country, we also speak an agglutinative language. Then I knew he was Finnish, and was interested. I asked if he believed in the Ural-Altaic language family: a theory about how Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, Korean, and Japanese were related to each other. Linguists stopped believing it in the 1960s, but I thought it might be true, because of all the similarities I had noticed between Hungarian and Turkish grammar. Juho said that he had had a similar experience when he studied Japanese. He asked whether it was theoretically possible in Turkish, as in Finnish and Japanese, to make an infinitely long nested word expressing an infinitely long delegation of commandfor example, a single word that meant: I ordered him to order him to order him to order him to order him to order him to do it. I thought about it and realized that you could make such a word. Juho was twenty-three, like Ivan, but already had a Ph.D., in both chemistry and physics. He belonged to a society of fellows, who all lived here for three years, and were paid to do whatever they wanted. One fellow was working on a new classification of mammals. He thought mammals were classified wrong. Another was trying to use weather patterns to predict when the national soccer coach would be fired in Brazil. Wait, does that work? I think all he has to prove is that the weather isnt worse than the other existing means of prediction. I asked what Juhos project was. First he said something about trying to build a clavichord. Then he said he was teaching his computer to recognize the concept of a chair. He turned his computer to face me, displaying one window full of illegibly tiny lines of code, and another window with a grid of photographs of chairs. He wasnt sure if he wanted to include armchairs and stools. Or this, he said, clicking on a photo of a plastic childs chair in the shape of the purple animated lumpcould its name really have been Grimace?that was friends with Ronald McDonald. Juho said that his favorite Finnish candy was called turkinpippuri, which meant Turkish peppers, and contained sal ammoniac, which was the product of hydrochloric acid and ammonia. Do they have these in Turkey? he asked. I dont think so, I said. You have to try them, he said. Someday I will give you some. I audited a few meetings of an ethics seminar taught by a famous philosophy professor from Oxford. He had wire-rimmed glasses and wild white hair, and used a lot of overhead transparencies, usually putting them on upside-down or backward. The transparencies were charts and graphs, about the quality of life for different populations. One question in the ethics seminar was how to weigh the benefit of a slight improvement in the present quality of life for millions of people, against a risk of great harm to millions of people who hadnt been born yet. It was complicated because, if you improved the present quality of life, then more people would have childrenmeaning that the people you were potentially harming in the future were people who might not otherwise have been born, so maybe you had still done them a favor. A lot of ethical questions were related to failing to cause people to be born. Was it morally wrong to not have a child, if you knew she would be happy? Was it morally wrong to have a child when you were fourteen, instead of later, if you knew that the later child would be happier? What if you knew that most of her life would be happy, but the last five years would be extremely unhappy? I didnt get why the extremely unhappy person wasnt allowed to kill herself before she messed up her average. I wished there was a class where they could teach you how to calculate the right time to die. The current arrangementfor everyone to sit there piously waiting for whenever their body happened to shut downseemed so far from ideal. My grandmother often said that she had lived too long, because she was in constant pain and had outlived her husband and friends. Far from being taken at its face value, this statement was treated as a kind of bon mot demonstrating my grandmothers love of debate. My mother said that my grandmother was feisty and enjoyed life. She said that she enjoyed eating soft-boiled eggs. The ethics professor was smart. When anyone made a suggestion or asked a question, he half smiled and immediately rattled off all kinds of implications that a normal person wouldnt have thought of if they had sat there for years. He was kind, too, never saying anything to make anyone feel dumb. The one time I asked a question, he jumped up and down, and even drew a picture. It was a relief that the person they sent to teach you ethics wasnt some kind of asshole. Nonetheless, the ethics seminar always left me feeling dissatisfied and anxious. Quality of life: as if we knew it, and could measure it. I wanted to know what it was: the quality of life. Lakshmi said it was weird that I wasnt on the literary magazine, like everyone else who wanted to be a writer, or like Lakshmi herself, who wasnt a writer but cared about writing. I didnt get what Lakshmi meant when she said she wasnt a writer. Im rubbish at it, she said. Well, none of us are good. No, its different. I used to write poems.... Horror flickered over her face and I dropped the subject. Joining the literary magazine hadnt previously occurred to me. I didnt want to be an editor, or run a magazine, so why would I want to do a fake version of those things in college? Also, the people who were the most into the literary magazine were the kind of guys who seemed unable to conceal their glee about all the famous writers who had been there a hundred years ago, or fifty years ago. It wasnt that I had any particular problem with Wallace Stevens or John Ashbery, but I wasnt about to join a club to chortle about them. But now it turned out that Lakshmi and other people I knew were actually already on the literary magazine, and I understood from what they said that not joining was making some kind of statement, so I decided to apply. Everyone was randomly assigned to a tutor: someone already on the literary magazine who was supposed to help with your application essay. My tutor was Rileys friend, Lucas. I felt a kinship with Lucas, because he read as much as I did, and because his parents had grown up on different continents and now lived separately. Lucas had gone to school in New York but spent all his vacations overseas, and was neither as impermeably American as Riley, who had never left the United States, nor as confidently international as Joanne or Lakshmi. He had a familiar air of displaced embarrassment, an anxiety about speaking languages poorly, which one didnt encounter in people who had done any of their schooling in the same country where most of their relatives lived. For the application essay, you had to read a short story, describe its strengths and weaknesses, and say what revisions you would ask for if you were going to publish it. I met Lucas for lunch, so he could give me a photocopy of the story. I kept waiting for him to give me advice, but he didnt. When I brought it up, he acted as if I was joking. We ended up just talking about books, as usual. Lucas had a way of talking about writing that seemed to hint at some previously unsuspected world of competence and collegiality. It was from Lucas that I first heard the phrase good on a sentence level. He said it in a self-deprecating tone, indicating that he was attributing it to other people. To think that not only Lucas himself, but also other people, had also had the experience of reading a book where the individual sentences had delightful rhythm and word choices, but some other part of it gave you a bad feeling. To think there was a name for that feeling of mixed gratitude and disappointment that I had dismissed as too private to name. The short story for the application was about a plumber who had sex with a housewife whose toilet he was fixing. I wrote down some ways that I thought the story could be less dumb than it was, and gave them to Lucas. I got onto the literary magazine. Lakshmi was voted in charge of parties: an area in which her expertise was widely recognized. Recently, on leaving a party in Boston, Lakshmi and her friends had run into some people who had graduated last year, one of whom had somehow attached herself to Lakshmi and asked her if she knew a Turkish girl named Selin. It was bizarre, Lakshmi said. I forget her name. Zina, Zelda, something like that. I gaped. Zita? Thats it. Who is she? Ivans ex-girlfriend. His ex? Why is she so keen to talk to you? She asked for your number. Should I have given it to her? I wasnt sure if youd been avoiding her. What does she want? I dont know. What was she like? Very interested in you. Short. Not smartly dressed. Did he dump you for her, or her for you? I think they had broken up before I met him, I said. It figures, she said. I didnt ask what she meant. I had always assumed that Lakshmis family was rich, until I found out that she hadnt bought even a single book for any of her classes. She had most of the books, but they were hand-me-downs from her older friends: glamorous postcolonial upperclassmen, who also took Lakshmi to New York to do clothes shopping at invitation-only sales and at the kind of consignment stores where rich women and teenagers offloaded once-worn couture, using the proceeds to buy each others anxiety and ADHD medications. I had never heard of such goings-on, which Lakshmi spoke of as routine. The skill of appearing to have money turned out to be something Lakshmi had learned from her father, a diplomat. She had grown up in palatial residences around the world where, attended by servants, chauffeurs, and gardeners, her parents had entertained on a lavish scale, without owning any of the things in their house. All the Singaporean students, including Joanne, had the same scholarship: full tuition plus a stipend, in exchange for which they had to work for the Singaporean government for some number of years after graduation. Joanne cut her own hair, didnt like expensive clothes or makeup, and used liquid castile soap as shampoo. She used the stipend to buy a carbon road bike and a laptop with a built-in CD-ROM: treating these items with a kind of respectful ruefulness that seemed to embody her general attitude toward what the Singaporeans called their bond. It was complicated, in Joannes case, by the fact that her parents could technically buy her out, because her mother was an American citizen: a piece of information that we all knew, even me, but that her parents had apparently never discussed with Joanne. The most famous Singaporean at Harvard, Percival, was a vermilion-haired classics major who organized seasonal Eleusinian Mysteries where they did psychedelics and roasted a piglet. Most non-Singaporean people didnt know that Percival was from Singapore. But he was often invoked by the other Singaporeans, as a symbol of what could happen because of your bond. In high school they had known him as a compliant, blazer-wearing math Olympian. The Singaporean students arrangement struck me at first as somehow extreme and archaic. But the more I learned about everyones situation, the more it seemed that everyone had a bond; it was just less formal, and not legally enforced, and came from their parents and not a whole country. Riley had a full scholarship from the pharmaceutical company where her mother worked in marketing. Nobody else in her family had done particularly well in school, and Riley was the one who had to become a doctor. It seemed related to the bond that Joanne volunteered ten hours a week teaching GED prep at an adult education programthe same one I had quit last year. Every weekday, she biked six miles to the housing project, returning in the same unruffled mood. When I asked her if the people there ever stressed her out, she just looked thoughtful and said, Some of them can be a little bit tense. In my case, volunteering had been my mothers idea. It was when I had mentioned getting a job. In her worldview, my getting a job was an insultlike accusing her of not providing for me. In high school, I had done my best to seem grateful, and to be grateful, because I knew how much more fortunate I was than the kids who had to workeither because they were poor, or because their parents were the kind of rich people who thought it was harmful for their children to be spared any kind of hassle. It was usually the people I thought of as all-American who were like thatthe white people, as my high school friend Clarissa called them. I had been surprised to learn that Clarissa, whose parents were from China, did not consider herself white. According to Clarissa, I wasnt white, either. But I asked my mother, and my mother had said, sounding scandalized, that of course we were white. Non-poor parents who came from other countries, or who were Jewish, often didnt want their kids to have jobs. One rationale was that our earning power was so trivial that it wasnt worth the trouble it would cause for them. Leoras mothers attitude was: I dont have time to pick you up from your fake job. Leoras mother always did find the most insulting way of phrasing anything. Im not going to listen to a ten-year-old, she would say, or a seven-year-old or a twelve-year-old, in a voice that dismissed everything you said absolutely, with no grounds for appeal. That was one way I was more fortunate than Leora: my parents often solicited my opinion and, when they didnt, it didnt seem to be because of some principle they felt proud of. And yet I knew that Leora considered herself more fortunate than me, because she had brothers and sisters, and because she had never been through anything like a divorce. But my parents were the only ones I knew who never acted like I owed them money for being alive, or talked about kids being spoiled or selfish, or said that I had to be a doctor, or took other adults side over mine. I was so grateful that sometimes I sat in my room and cried. This year, I had decided to get a job. The highest-paying student job, Dorm Crew, was presented as a fun team-building experience, except that instead of going to the wilderness, you cleaned other kids bathrooms. Last year, Priya and Joannes Dorm Crew person was also a math teaching assistant, and had written problems for them on the mirror in dry-erase marker. Depending on their answers, he would leave a crying face or a smiley face, or, once, when they solved a particularly difficult problem, a dolphin-shaped bath bead. Dorm Crew, which paid up to twelve dollars an hour, was only for federal work-study students, which meant your parents had to make under a certain amount of money for you to do it. Svetlanas roommate, Dolores, was on full scholarship, and had a work-study job washing dishes in one of the dining halls, so she could give her parents money to send to their parents. Some people spoke positively about Dorm Crew, but I never heard anyone say anything good about dishwashing, except that the hours were more flexible. The best-paid job where you didnt actually have to do anything unpleasant was library check-out, and was also work-study. Non-work-study jobs started at four seventy-five an hour, and it wasnt like they were interesting. The interesting jobs were called internships, and were unpaid. I got an off-campus job doing data entry for a gardening catalog. They gave me lists of addresses of people who might be interested in gardening, and I typed them on a computer. They paid by the number of addresses. When I typed as fast as I could, I made almost twenty dollars an hour. But then I started to get shooting pains in my wrists and hands, and when I went to the student health center, they said it was from typing, so I quit. After that, I found an on-campus job posting at the Ukrainian Research Institute that wasnt work-study, but still somehow paid seven dollars an hour. At the interview, I tried really hard to show how motivated I was. Your passion for Russian literature is quite inspiring, but you do know this is a Ukrainian research institute? And its mostly office work, said the interviewer, Rob, who sounded like he was trying to dissuade me. But I talked about how much I loved office work and also the violinist Nathan Milstein, and in the end Rob said I could work there. The Ukrainian Research Institute was in a wooden colonial house, with offices in the different rooms. About a third of the people who worked there were actually Ukrainian, and seemed always on the verge of being really upset. If anyone said the Ukraine, instead of Ukraine, or assumed that some word in Ukrainian was the same as in Russian, or asked whether a Ukrainian writer wrote in Russian, it was enough to push them over the edge. This kind of touchiness was familiar to me from Turkish people, and gave me a fond, protective feeling. The futon in the common room was covered in the batik cloth that Priya draped over everythingas if it helped. Riley and Priya were at lab. I wasnt sure where Joanne was, but Joanne was so quiet, and so often asleep. As I was thinking admiringly of Joannes ability to fall asleep anywhere, I saw to my astonishment that she was actually asleep under the table, a few feet away, in what I had thought was an empty sleeping bag. When I checked my email, I found a forward from the president of the Turkish students club. Do you feel like getting up at 8 on a Saturday, putting on your biggest smile, and looking like a constructive, sexually active, ethnically ambiguous member of the Harvard community? he had written. The forwarded message was an invitation from Crimson Key, the student group that gave guided tours of campus. They were trying to get different international and interracial students to greet some kind of visiting delegation, thereby making Harvard look more diverse than it would have if only Crimson Key people had showed up. It occurred to me that the quality of emails from the Turkish club had risen dramatically since last year, when nobody said anything funny or interesting, or expressed any kind of distance from the people like Crimson Key. This, in combination with a positive impression I had of the Singaporean club, motivated me to try going to a meeting of the Turkish club. Everyone in the Turkish club seemed to have gone to the same famous high school in Istanbul. All they talked about, other than their high school, was where in Boston you could get some particular kind of cheese. (You could get it at the Armenian store in Watertown.) Almost nobody said anything funny, unless you counted teasing each other about eating or drinking too much. In general, they seemed less like students than like miniature lame adults. The only person I enjoyed talking to was the president, ahin. He had gone to the same high school as the others, but seemed depressed, and said things that were funny, and didnt seem to care or even notice that my Turkish wasnt as good as everyone elses. When we talked, he just switched between Turkish and English, like he wasnt even noticing we were doing it. He was obsessed with birds, and later I often saw him striding around campus, wearing yellow sports headphones and glaring at the groundbecause he was memorizing birdcalls, trying to get grant money to travel to the remote places where the most interesting birds congregated. Memorizing everything the birds said seemed like as much of a hassle for ahin as learning Russian was for me. He was the only other Turkish person I had ever met who was actually interested in some specific field of knowledge, and who wasnt just automatically doing medicine, engineering, or the thing they called management. There were two grad students, Burcu and Ula, who sometimes came to the club meetings to circulate petitions about the Armenian genocide. They were really stressful peoplenot just about the petitions, but about everything. You could see exactly what their parents were like. Most of the petitions cited two professors at Princeton who said that the massacre of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire had been part of a regional conflict involving pro-Russian Armenian groups, and wasnt technically a genocide. Sometimes, the petitions were addressed to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, urging them not to mention the Armenian genocide in different events or exhibits. Those petitions often worked, because there were enough people at the Holocaust Museum who didnt want to imply that anything else that had ever happened had been similar to the Holocaust. Other petitions were addressed to American legislators, to try to get them to not say that April 24 was Armenian Genocide Recognition Day. These were less effective, because there were more Armenian people who wanted a recognition day than there were Turkish people who didnt want one. The Armenian genocide was something I had been hearing about from American peoples parents since I was in elementary school. It was often the first thing they brought up: either a carpet they had bought, or, defiantly, Jims brother-in-law is Armenian, or Our pediatrician is Greek. I had never heard any Turkish people say anything bad about Armenians, and I knew how much American people loved to talk about ethnic hatreds, so I had always assumed it was just one of their fixations and didnt reflect anything real. It was a disappointment to learn that such petitions actually existed. It seemed churlish to lobby against a recognition day for a massacre, whether it had occurred genocidally, or in the course of what some people at Princeton considered to be a normal war. (What even differentiated a great and honorable war, where you were trying to secure some land by murdering people, from a shameful genocide, where you were trying to secure some land by murdering people?) On the other hand, when Ula talked about how the French and American governments were always trying to pass acts acknowledging genocides in other countries, but never called it a genocide about the Algerians or the American Indians, I felt an annoyance at the French and American governments that bordered on physical pain. Burcu and Ula sometimes tried to get ahin to circulate their petitions for them, but he never did. A famous Soviet bard died. All the Russian instructors were depressed. I saw Galina Fyodorovna crying in the photocopier room. The bard had been an emblem of the Moscow street culture of children, particularly on one famous street. In his honor, all the Russian students had to memorize poems by Pushkin. This made sense according to Russian peoples logic, where everything always connected to Pushkin. For our class, the thing we had to learn was a verse from Eugene Onegin. I was excited, because Eugene Onegin was the second Russian book I had ever read, in high school, right after Anna Karenina. It was written all in a kind of sonnet that Pushkin had invented, so it was really hard to translate. That was one of the main reasons to learn Russian: so you could actually read Eugene Onegin. At some point, Vladimir Nabokov had gotten so mad at all the existing English translations of Eugene Onegin that he wrote his own, which was super-literal and didnt rhyme, and ruined his friendship with Edmund Wilson: a grown man whom people called Bunny. That was the one I decided to read. My mother had a lot of Nabokovs novels, but she didnt have Eugene Onegin. I bought it myself at the Barnes & Noble on Route 22: one of the first places I drove to, in my moms car, when I got my permit. It was only because I had loved Anna Karenina that I had even wanted to read Eugene Onegin. Once I did, I realized the extent to which Anna Karenina had always been my mothers book, more than mine. The huge conflict in Anna Karenina was how Anna was torn between her lover and her child, and her husband was forcing her to choose between them. So, too, had my mother felt torn between her work and her love for her child, which her husband didnt believe in, and her boyfriend didnt understand. I knew she had compared Jerry to Vronsky and my father to Karenin. Almost all the women in Anna Karenina were mothers, and all of them had husbands or loversexcept that one girl, Varenka; but even with Varenka, Koznyshev almost proposed to her when they were picking mushrooms. Koznyshev had therefore at least contemplated having sex with Varenka. There were no women in that book with whom nobody thought about having sex. Tatiana, the heroine of Eugene Onegin, wasnt a mother. She had a mother: a fretful, conventional, out-of-it person who limited her activities. Tatiana was a teenager, and lived in the provinces. She had no way of going anywhere, read novels all the time, and wasnt trying to have sex with anyone. Even when Eugene Onegin showed upall she really wanted was to see him every now and then, and think about him, and keep reading her novels. It was only when she found out he was leaving that she went into despair, and wrote him a letter. Tatianas letter was famous in Russiaeveryone knew it by heart. It was one of two passages we could memorize, for the bards memorial service: either the first stanza of the book, or the beginning of Tatianas letter. Most people, including Svetlana, chose the first stanza, because it was shorter, but I wanted to learn Tatianas letter. Svetlana was really good at memorizing. Her father had taught her something called the method of loci. You pictured a route through a building, or among some buildings, and imagined yourself placing all the things you wanted to remember at different placeslocialong the route. Then, all you had to do to remember the things was to mentally retrace the route. Svetlana suggested we map out an actual walk we could take, with stops that we would use to remember our stanzas. Like the Stations of the Cross? That actually works really well, because there were fourteen Stations of the Cross, and there are fourteen lines in an Onegin stanza. We decided to start in the Yard, at the dorm where we had lived last year, and make our way toward the river. It had been overcast all day, but we didnt get rained on until we got to our old dorm. We stood there for a moment, drinking it all in: the blank brick faade, the pointy gables. There was a feeling of rejection, knowing that our IDs wouldnt open the door anymore. New freshmen were going in and out. Some had clearly put a lot of thought into their clothes. Others seemed to have waterproofed their own persons as peremptorily as if they were lawn furniture. The first line of Tatianas letterI write to youwhat would one more?was easy to remember, and to associate with this building, because that was where I had written to Ivan. The basic idea of the letter was how irretrievably it compromised her, just by existing. How, by writing it, she had put herself totally in Onegins power, entrusted herself to his honor. She would never have done anything like that, she said, if things could have continued as they had beenif she could only see Onegin once a week, exchange a few words, and then think and think about one thing until their next meeting. I couldnt believe it said that: think and think about one thing. That was all I had wanted, too. Outside the Caf Gato Rojo, in the grad student union, Svetlana had to memorize a line about Onegins uncle being sick. Conveniently, Svetlana had once gotten really sick at the Gato Rojo, when she was meeting her French tutor. My line was about how I had exposed myself to being punished by Eugene Onegins scorn. Well, I knew that Ivans girlfriend, Eunice, who was a grad student, held her office hours in the Gato Rojo; and the reason I knew it was that I had fingered her from online and her plan had her office hours. I felt scornful of myself for knowing that. At the end of our walk, Svetlana headed back toward the T station to go to therapy. I sat on a bench and thought about Tatianas letter to Oneginabout whether it counted as a success. On the one hand, they didnt end up together. And then there was a duel and a guy died. No, you couldnt say that the immediate outcomes had been positive. On the other hand, Pushkin himself loved the letter. He said he kept a copy of it, and read and reread it. Wasnt Pushkins love, and the love of everyone who read Eugene Onegin, more important than Onegin acting like a loser? Pushkin said that some readers would condemn Tatianathey would call her impulsive or unseemly. But those readers werent being truthful. What they really meant was that Tatiana wasnt strategic. She didnt know how to play games. The coquette reasons coolly; Tatiana in dead earnest loves and unconditionally yields. I loved Tatiana, because she didnt hide what she felt, and I loved Pushkin for calling out the kind of people who conflated discretion and virtue. You still met people like that: people who acted as if admitting to any feelings of love, before you had gotten a man to buy you stuff, was a violationnot of pragmatism, or even of etiquette, but of morality. It meant you didnt have self-control, you couldnt delay gratification, you had failed the stupid marshmallow test. Ugh. I refused to believe that dissimulation was more virtuous than honesty. If there were rewards you got from lying, I didnt want them. This was consonant with how women in my family talked about our shared character. In matters of love, we were too smart and honest to play games. We could only be happy with the kind of man who didnt need some huge charade. The men who needed a charade, though more numerous, werent worth bothering with. Not only was it impossible for us to attract them, because we were constitutionally incapable, but they werent worth attracting, they werent capable of real love. And yet, from an early age, I had seen women I was related to, like my aunts and my mother, prostrated by suffering because of men. Prostrated by suffering was the meaning I attached later to the Turkish phrases I half understood at the time: kendini yerden yere att, or ban tatan taa vurdu. A person threw himself or herself [but lets face it, probably herself] from floor to floor, or beat her head from one stone to another stone. The reason she behaved in this way was because a man had paid more attention to another womanto the kind of woman who played games. And good riddance: clearly, the man had been intimidated by our intelligence and honesty. The implication of good riddancethat love would switch off, like an electric light, once you realized the object of your love was dumb, or cowardly, or had bad tastewas not strictly borne out by observation. There were signs that it was, in fact, possible to suffer enormously over cowards with bad taste. But maybe such misfortunes only befell women of an earlier generationwomen who were, as they themselves assured me, less fortunate and less smart than I was. It was a relief to find Pushkin corroborating what my relatives had always said: that it was better to be smart and honest than to play games. On the whole, I thought, I had been right to write to Ivan. Just by typing some words on a computer, I had caused so many things to happen in the worldsleep to be lost, plane tickets to be bought, money to change hands. In a way, it had been a test of what a person could achieve just through writing. But there were also times when I worried that I had acted foolishly and without dignity. I thought of the ball near the beginning of Anna Karenina, when Kitty looked lovingly at Vronsky, who was already really into Anna: and long afterwards, for several years after, that look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame. Kitty literally almost died of shame, and had to go to a German spa. Then she confided in Varenka, and Varenka said: Why, what is there shameful? You didnt tell a man, who didnt care for you, that you loved him, did you? And Kitty said of course not, she never said anything. For some reason, what I thought of then was how my mother had told me that, at some point in the 1970s, my father had referred to Anna Karenina as a bourgeois novel about a fallen woman, and had expressed surprise that my mother should be interested in such a book. Was it possible that he had really said that? My parents sometimes remembered things differently from each other, and from me. Once, when we were in middle school, my father had taken me and Leora to New York to see Les Misrables. In the car afterward, he had complained about the sentimentalization of motherhoodhow motherhood, mother love, was supposed to automatically make a character saintly, but in fact Fantine in Les Misrables was a prostitute and had dubious morality, and wasnt like Jean Valjean, who had stolen a loaf of bread to feed his family. It had always been part of my identity to feel more objective than either of my parentsto be able to choose between their views, to retain the parts I found useful and discard the rest. On the one hand, I agreed that there was something annoying about the phrase mother love, which felt related to the feeling I got when my mother talked about her child. On the other hand, I recognized in my fathers opinions about Les Misrables the kind of tendentious, impermeable, prejudiced discourse that a person had to ignorethe ignoring of which, indeed, was a cardinal skill of adult life. Wasnt the whole point of Les Misrables, and not a very subtle one, that Fantine being a prostitute wasnt that different from Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family? And the way my father said to feed his family was at least as annoying as the way my mother said my child. On this, as on many issues, I concluded that, although neither of my parents was 100 percent right, I would, if pressed, agree more with my mother. The Fourth Week Over the weekend, Riley, Priya, Joanne, and I went shopping in Boston. At the Garment District, where they sold clothes for seventy-five cents a pound, I bought a burnt-orange corduroy shirt and a synthetic charmeuse wraparound skirt with huge purple flowers. We were shopping, it seemed, for fabrics. I didnt totally get it: fabrics seemed like the one thing we had enough of. Nonetheless, at the textile store, I picked out a few yards of brown satin that seemed like it might work for making room dividers. We spent the afternoon in Somerville chasing around a TV and VCR that a postdoc guy had said he would give to Priya. The level of coordination, the number of phone calls and changes of plan, made it feel more like a hostage negotiation than a voluntary exchange of property. It began to seem possible, then likely, that the VCR did not exist. It was a constant problem for Priya: men desperately, bald-facedly offering her things they didnt have. That was what it was to be beautiful. Walking back from Somerville, we kept passing curbside piles of discarded household items. I pulled out a doormat that said I AM NOT YOUR DOORMAT. Its like its capable of self-deception! I enthused. Joanne asked in a kind voice if I wanted to take it home and have it be our doormat. I imagined seeing it every day, this protesting resentful doormat: we would crush its conception of itself, again and again, with our feet. I replaced the mat where I had found it, between a CD tower and part of a disassembled futon. A few blocks later, Riley found another doormat that had seven cats on it spelling WELCOME with their tails. It was clearly the correct doormat. When we got back, one of Riley and Priyas premed friends, Lewis, was hanging around the entryway. I had been puzzled at first as to why this guy Lewis was always underfoot, but it turned out he was obsessed with Priya. He had told her that he wasnt sure whether most other guys would even find her attractive, but he couldnt get her out of his mind. What if he was the only guy who found me attractive? Priya asked, her limpid eyes wide with horror. Joanne left for a Singaporean club dinner. She asked me if I wanted to come, and I felt touched. But when the Singaporeans were all together, they started to speak Singlish and it took too much energy to try to follow the conversation. I spent the next hour in Rileys and my bedroom, making a canopy above the top bunk by duct-taping the brown satin to the ceiling and then sticking thumbtacks in the duct tape. It came out really well. Now I could read in bed and feel like nobody was looking at me. Back in the common room, Riley and Priya and Lewis had been joined by two other premed people: an approximately Lewis-like guy in a houndstooth pullover, and a girl who was as beautiful as Priya, though in a different way. Priya was sitting cross-legged on the floor, in frayed jeans and a scoop-neck jersey, her face framed adorably by flyaway hair; the other girl was perched on the edge of the futon, legs crossed, her white blouse and pencil skirt looking not just tailored but actually ironed. There was something familiar about her, though I couldnt put my finger on it. Lewis was sitting right in the middle of the futon with his arms outstretched over the back, looking way more at home than I felt, even though I lived there. Most of his discourse consisted of alternately hostile or flattering remarks directed to or about Priya. Priya had made a bowl of Toll House cookie dough that everyone was passing around, digging in with cafeteria spoons. Only the girl with the ironed clothes declined to eat any cookie dough and, at the first pause in the conversation, immediately started talking about how she didnt know whether she was addicted to smoking. Everyone looked at her in puzzlement. She said that she smoked exactly one cigarette every day, alone, at sunset, on the roof of some particular building. I dont know if Im addicted, though, she said. Riley told a story about her cousin who had quit smoking when his wife had a baby, and had gotten addicted to Nicorette, which was so expensive that he was always stashing wads of chewed-up Nicorette around the house for possible future use. It had all ended at the pediatric ER, when his two-year-old child had managed to stick its own testes together with about ten pieces of used Nicorette that it had pried off from the undersides of tables. I told a story about how my dad had once worked in a lab at a VA hospital on the same floor with a guy who managed to get dogs addicted to cigarettes. There was a tracheostomy tube so the dogs had to inhale the smoke. At first the dogs hated smoking, but eventually they got addicted, and when the cigarettes were taken away, they howled, all day and all night. I didnt realize until I got to the end that it was a really depressing story. There was a pause. I dont know if Im addicted, though, the girl said. She described her smoking ritual, minutely, though it was less that she imparted a lot of detail than that she used many words, identifying and re-identifying the details of time and place, as if they were inherently interesting and unique to her. She kept the cigarettes in a vintage cigarette case, in her underwear drawer. Lewis seemed to perk up when she mentioned underwear. It was while she was talking about what she did when it rained that I recognized her: she was Peters friend, the one who had asked for Ivans email address, and who had talked about the genius of Johannes Kepler. I had mixed feelings about this beautiful nonsmoker. On the one hand, I despised her for talking so much and saying so little, and for seeming so unaware of Rileys expression. On the other hand, at least she was talking with enthusiasm about something that she liked to do, alone, just for the sake of having an experience, or thinking of herself a certain way. She had returned now to the theme of not knowing whether she could call herself a smoker. The point, she said, wasnt the cigarette itself, so much as... [the time of day, the cigarette case, the dresser]. I saw Priya look at Riley with stricken doelike eyes, and understood that Priya, too, was critical of the beautiful nonsmoker. I felt shocked, realizing that I had somehow grouped them togetherbecause of their beauty, and because they seemed to inhabit a similar social persona: that of a magical fairy, inviting others to share in her bewilderment at her own mystery and specialness. I had failed to draw a distinction between them that was evident, to Priya herself, as well as to Riley. It was true that, when Priya acted that way, she did it more subtly, with a greater awareness of other peoples level of interest. Certainly Priya would never have droned on for so long. She would just drop a dreamy allusion to her love of steak tartare, or of neural networks, and it would float gracefully in the air for a moment before disappearing. When I tuned back in to the conversation, I realized with an undertone of panic that that girl was still talking about how she smoked one cigarette every day. Why was this happening? Why were we all sitting here? She was reiterating how she had to be alone; how she had dealt in the past with the efforts of different people to join her. Then she returned, with sickening inevitability, to her inability to state whether or not she was addicted. Well, said Lewis, in his bantering tone, the next time you go to the roof, do everything the same as usual, but dont light the cigarette. If you experience withdrawal, then youre addicted. I stood up, more abruptly than I had intended. I have to go, I blurted. Everyone looked at me, so I added: I just remembered a book I have to read. Sometimes these things cant wait, Riley said in a reasonable tone that contrasted with my mode of being. We all laughed, and I was able to make my escape. I hadnt really been planning to read a book, or had any plan at all, other than a vague idea of seeing what was playing at the film archive. The last screening was starting in two minutes, and it was a gender-transgressive docudrama about a prostitute in war-torn Belgrade who had a special way of bringing peace to the Balkans: by acting as a kind of lightning rod for the erotic desires of violent men. Although I had some interest in war-torn Belgrade, I didnt want to show up alone, late, and out of breath, to a movie about violent sex. I started walking in circles around the room, mechanically tidying my side, gathering together the scraps of fabric and tape, the receipts and plastic bags and flyers and pages of Russian homework. I found the used copy of Nadja I had just bought, and decided to go read it. The street felt darker than usual. Every few yards, muffled music drifted out of dark or semi-dark windows. Small groups of people staggered by, the girls laughing hysterically and collapsing against the guys chests. I knew that that was what a person was supposed to be doing, but I didnt know why, or how. I put on my Walkman. Listening to an all-Spanish album by Itzhak Perlman made me feel a shimmer of hope, as if life itself might be like those deadly violinistic showpieces: important, complex, to be performed with precision and flair. The regular libraries closed early on Saturdays, so I headed to Mather, to use the house library. In the TV area, a bunch of guys were sitting tensely on a sofa, and then suddenly they all leaped to their feet and started pumping their fists and hooting. Yes! Yes! Yes! one of them shouted. I felt relieved when I got to the library: a soundless concrete cube, with a spiral staircase through the middle. There were only two other people there: one was listening to headphones with his eyes closed; the other twirled a pen between his fingers in an elaborate way while glaring into a giant textbook. Both were Asian. I felt a wave of kinship and admiration toward them, because of how they had opted out of what everyone else thought was cool. The first line of NadjaWho am I?was just like I remembered it. The next pages were still unreadably boring. But this time, I kept going. If there was anything in there that could change my life, I wasnt going to let a few boring pages stand in my way. On page 17, I felt a thrill of excitement at the mention of J. K. Huysmans: the author of Against Nature, the book from which I had learned about living aesthetically. When you were trying to solve a mystery, and you came across a name you had encountered earlier in your investigation, it was a sign that you were on the right trail. Andr Breton praised J. K. Huysmans for being different from the kind of conventional noveliststhose empiricists of the novel, he called themwho wasted their time trying to transform real people into fictional characters. I felt nonplussed. Wasnt that what a novelists job was: transforming real people into fictional characters? But Breton seemed to actually be angry about it. Someone suggested to an author I know, in connection with a work of his... whose heroine might be too readily recognized, that he change at least the color of her hair. As a blonde, apparently, she might have avoided betraying a brunette. I do not regard such a thing as childish, I regard it as monstrous. In these words, I caught a glimmer of some possibility of freedom. I realized that my inability to do what he was talking aboutto disguise the people I knew and turn them into fictional charactershad been the biggest problem I had in writing, and thus in my plan of life. In some way it was a bigger problem than Ivanor maybe Ivan was a part of that problem, which had predated him by many years. I had wanted to become a novelist before I even knew how to read, back when I could only consume books by having them read to me, and none of them seemed long enough. They left too many questions unanswered, too many ramifications unexplored. My parents told me that I was expecting too much from Frog and Toad Are Friends: it wasnt a novel. In that way, I understood that a novel would explain all the things I still wanted to know, like why Toad was the way he waswhy Toad was essentially unwell, and why Frog helped Toad, whether he really wanted Toad to get better, or whether he benefited in some way from Toads unwellness. I understood that novels, unlike childrens books, were serious and important and that, just as my parents job was to treat patients in a hospital, so, too, was it someones job to write novels. Every civilized country had such people. They were in some way the very mark of civilization. Once I learned how to write, I did it all the time, filling up one notebook after another, recording different things that people said, or that I had read in books. Adults would ask if I was writing a novel. I assumed that I was: that what I was writing was already somehow a novel, or that this kind of writing would someday naturally segue into novel-writing. It wasnt until high school, when I took my first creative writing class, that I began to sense trouble. I realized, with shock, that I wasnt good at creative writing. I was good at grammar and arguing, at remembering things people said, and at making stressful situations seem funny. But it turned out these werent the skills you needed in order to invent quirky people and give them arcs of desire. I already had my hands full writing about the people I actually knew, and all the things they said. That was what I needed writing for. Now I had to invent extra people and think of things for them to say? It turned out that writing what you were already thinking about wasnt creative, or even writing. It was navel-gazing. To be obsessed by your own life experience was childish, egotistical, unartistic, and worthy of contempt. I tried to get around the problem by ascribing my own thoughts and observations to a fictional characterone with a neutral, universal name, because I didnt want to seem like I was constantly harping on being Turkish. I didnt like books where the whole point seemed to be that the person was from some country, and they kept going on about the food. And yet, the things I was writing about somehow didnt make sense unless the people were from another country, and I didnt know enough about any other countries besides Turkey. There was a creative writing workbook, with exercises. You had to fill out questionnaires about your characters, with their favorite food or color. I felt despair: what kind of person had a favorite color? Then I thought, OK: that was why you needed your imagination, to think of someone different from yourself. The words, tacos, beige, written on a piece of looseleaf paper made me feel the foreclosing of every possibility of anything exciting ever happening to me in the rest of my life. Nearly every exercise mentioned a diner in some capacity, as did many of the stories we read. Clearly there was a connection between creative writing and diners. It felt fortuitous, because I thought a lot about diners. That was when I was living with my paternal aunt, who actually worked in a diner, illegally. The diner was owned by a guy from Adana who hired only Turkish people without work permits. It seemed at first like he was doing them a favor, but then this became less clear. One of the line cooks, for example, got a kidney stone, which everyone said was the most painful thing in the world next to childbirth. (What if people said boys had to have two kidney stones by the time they were thirtyas the man my aunt eventually married, enabling her to leave the diner, had often told me about childbirth?) The diner owner paid for the cooks surgery and then, once he had him in his debt, tortured him in inventive ways, for example by making him prepare tripe soup. Tripe soup had a distinctive smell that made some people really sick, and the line cook was one of those people. I recognized in this situation something narrative-rich, larger than me, appropriate for creative writing. But once I started trying to turn it into short fiction, I felt rude, even traitorous. I had only met the diner owner a few times, and he had never done anything to me personally, and my aunt said sometimes that he wasnt so bad. He often sent her home with free chicken cacciatore, and I ate it, too. Furthermore, I knew that the kidney stone and the tripe soup werent, in themselves, a story; I couldnt just copy them down and call it creative writing. I had to identify the universal human situation they represented, and develop it, using my imagination. Probably the cook would have to take action: somehow break free, or cause some problem to the diner owner. And yet I had seen that cook, Serdar. He was so clearly the kind of person who, despite complaining constantly, was basically respectful and ineffective. The only decisive thing I had ever heard of him doing was punching a wall when he found out that his mom in Adana had cancer, and everyone else had known but had been hiding it from him, so he wouldnt go crazy. So, when he found out, he had to go crazy. He ended up in the emergency room with a broken hand. My dad had paid for it, because by then my whole family felt sorry for him. I tried making Serdar the narrator, but it still seemed like I was patronizing him. I tried being the narrator myself, and saying I also worked at the diner. But it was too much the essence of who I was that I had never been made or allowed to work in a diner. I thought about asking my aunt for more details, but I felt too embarrassed. The diner represented just the kind of life problem that I was protected from and she was not. The creative writing class ended, and theoretically I never had to read or write about diners again. But the seed of panic had been planted. My eyes had been opened to the dissimilarity between the kind of writing I was always doing, and an actual novel. That was when the movie of The Remains of the Day came out, and my father bought all three of Kazuo Ishiguros novels, and I read them, too. How compact, self-contained, and mysterious they were; how little they disclosed of him, whoever he was, an English-language writer with the name Kazuo Ishiguro. How compassionate and imaginative of him to write novels about either super-English-sounding people living in a country house in England in the 1930s (who could not have been named Kazuo Ishiguro), or super-Japanese-sounding printmakers in Osaka in the 1940s (who could not have written a novel in English). Ishiguro wrote first-person, but the narrator was always unreliable, i.e., crazy or ignorant, and different from the author. What disciplinewhat lack of pride! All I was ever trying to do when I wrote, I realized, was to show how much I saw and understood. All my feelings of dauntedness were summed up by a quote on the cover of An Artist of the Floating World: Good writers aboundgood novelists are very rare. Kazuo Ishiguro is... not only a good writer, but also a wonderful novelist. The New York Times Book Review It was what I had been counting on, in order to get out: my sense of being a good writer. My stomach sank with the knowledge of how wrong I had been. The whole time everything had been happening with Ivan, I had always been writing about it in my notebook, or on the computer, and sometimes I wondered whether I would ever turn those pages into a novel. The thought made me feel ashamed. It felt shameful to be so unartistic and self-obsessed, to not want to invent richly fictional characters. It felt shameful to write a whole book about Ivan. What if he found out? For some reason, I found myself remembering how my mother and I used to laugh about Mommie Dearest, a book written by Joan Crawfords daughter, which neither of us had read, but which my mother often invoked, saying Mommie Dearest in a high-pitched voice, whenever she made me do anything. Then I remembered another joke my mother used to make, when she did anything she thought was wrong, like telling a white lie over the phone, or unbuckling her seat belt while driving: Dont put this in your novel. That, too, had always made me laugh, though there was an underlying assumption that was somehow troubling: that the disorder you experienced in your childhood was somehow to your credit, or capitalizable upon in later lifeeven though, or precisely because, it was a discredit to your mother. So your credit and your mothers credit were somehow at odds. But why was I thinking about my mother now, when the subject was Ivan? Ugh: Ivan. Telling anyone his name always felt like a betrayallike I was causing the way they pronounced it, either incorrectly or with elaborate and ironic correctness, as if to imply that he was pretentious because he didnt say Eye-van, the way literally nobody in the world except American people did. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone: I read that line in The Picture of Dorian Gray, and felt the sickening lurch of dishonor. And yethere was Andr Breton, saying just the opposite: I insist on knowing the names, on being interested only in books left ajar, like doors; I will not go looking for keys. All the work-arounds I thought I had inventedturning two real people into one fictional character, turning one real person into two characters, changing peoples appearances and nationalitieshe already knew about, and viewed as base tricks. He seemed proud of not changing anything, including himself. Was that something it was OK to feel self-righteous about? Was it possible that the kind of book he was describing could somehow be better than the novels I already knew aboutbetter than psychological literature, with all its fictitious plots? More pressingly: Was there a way that I could become a novelist, after all? Was it related to Huysmans and to the aesthetic life? What if I could use the aesthetic life as an algorithm to solve my two biggest problems: how to live, and how to write novels? In any real-life situation, I would pretend I was in a novel, and then do whatever I would want the person in the novel to do. Afterward, I would write it all down, and I would have written a novel, without having had to invent a bunch of fake characters and pretend to care about them. Around page 20, Breton abruptly dropped the life-or-death subject of real people and novels, and launched, for some reason, into a minute description of some coincidences he and his friends had experienced. Why were other peoples coincidences always so boring? Nadja herself didnt show up until page 64. Suddenly, perhaps still ten feet away, I saw a young, poorly dressed woman walking toward me.... I felt a thrill of recognition. So, being poorly dressed wasnt necessarily opposed to an aesthetic life, but could be consonant with it. Once Nadja came in, there was something on almost every page that seemed like a clue. For example: Nadja got sick and couldnt afford a doctor, and she decided to cure herself through manual labor, by getting a job in a bakery, and even in a pork-butchers. This was clearly related to a story Ivan had told me multiple times, about his high school friend, whose Slovenian girlfriend moved to Budapest and ended up having to work at a meatpacking plant. Ivan had always spoken of the Slovenian girlfriend in a laughing and admiring tone. I had never understood why. I had been alone with this mystery. Finally, here was another data point, because clearly Andr Breton also thought it was somehow funny or admirable that Nadja worked at a pork-butchers. I started keeping a running record in my notebook of everything in Nadja that seemed related to any of my problems. Soon, all I wanted to be doing was to be working on this list. The rows of page numbers and quotes looked a little bit like Pale Fire: a novel where the first half was a poem, and the second half was an autobiographical commentary by the poets mentally ill next-door neighbor. I wished I could write a book like that about Nadja, where I could explain each line, and how it applied in such a specific way to things that had happened in my life. I knew that nobody would want to read such a book; people would die of boredom. Why was it that science and history could be boring, but other books couldnt? When was the last time I had been so struck by anything in my real life as I was by the offhand disclosure that Andr Breton was married? Or by the even more offhand disclosure that Nadja had a daughter: a child of whose existence she has informed me with so many precautions and whom she adores? I read that line over and over; it changed everything. How old was the daughter, where, with whom? Why was Nadja wandering around Paris alone? I thought of my own mother, who adored me, and who had also fallen in love with a man who had eventually married someone else. Why did that happen to people? Was anyone even studying this stuff? Was anyone doing anything to fix it? The Slavic department had a different atmosphere at night: like an airport, or like the past. A film projector had been set up for the bards memorial service. A professor gave a speech thanking the language instructors for all their hard work, making it sound somehow pathetic. Like most of the literature professors, he was American. The language instructors were all from the former Soviet Union, and didnt have tenure, and werent called professor. I recited Tatianas letter too fast, but otherwise it went OK. A girl I didnt know read the same text but got stuck after four lines. I wondered if she was in love, and whether the guy was an idiot. Five people in a row recited the stanza about Onegins uncle. It was boring to hear the same thing over and over, until it was Svetlanas turn. How did she seem so much more alive than everyone else? Pushkins jokes became funny again when she said them. When Svetlana sat back down next to me, Matt, from the third-year class, sat in the empty seat on her other side, clapped her on the shoulder, and leaned over and said something to her, and her face turned pink. We watched some black-and-white footage of the bard singing a song about Pushkin, whom he called Alexander Sergeyevich, fitting the many syllables onto four or five notes, in a somehow poignant way. The song was called All the Same, Its Sad, and was about how, notwithstanding the benefits that had accrued to humanity in the years since Pushkins death, it was sad that we could no longer hang out with Alexander Sergeyevich. By the end, half the people in the room were crying. The saddest line was: not even for a quarter of an hour. There was a reception afterward, and Svetlana immediately took a glass of wine and started speaking Russian with the teachers and grad students. But I left early and went to the library to finish reading Nadja. Nadja had money troubles. She was resisting the threats of her landlord and his dreadful suggestions, and made no secret of the means she would employ to obtain money for herself. Breton seemed to think she should have been making it a secret. Well, at least that was one thing that had improved over the past seventy years. Girls werent constantly being forced to become prostitutes. Prostitutes, of course, still existed, but some people liked being prostitutes and thought it was empowering, and it was un-feminist to think they were victims. Were any people still forced to become prostitutes? When I thought about it, it seemed obvious that they were. Surely, though, it was less common than in the past. Literally every single old novel had someone in it who was forced to become a prostitute, whereas I had never heard of that happening to anyone I knew. I did know one girl who had posed for a Women of the Ivy League spread in Playboy. But modeling for Playboy to pay for Harvard was not the same as having sex with your landlord to not get evicted. At some point, Andr Breton started to find Nadja annoying. It was hard to tell what exactly Nadja had done wrong. Had she complained too much about having to become a prostitute? Had she made too many puns? It was as if it had suddenly just already happened. For some time, I had stopped understanding Nadja. Actually, perhaps we have never understood one another.... Ivan had said things like that: maybe we never really understood each other, maybe we never had a real conversation. I thought this was absurd. But his viewpoint invalidated mine. If one person thought it was a conversation, and the other person thought it wasnt a conversation, the second person was right. I am judging a posteriori, and I merely speculate when I say it could not be otherwise, Breton wrote. That was what Ivan was doing: judging a posteriori, acting as if everything between us had run some inevitable course. How unjust it was, when people treated the actual as limiting proof of the possible! I felt that this was what I was fighting against, and always had been: the tyranny of the particular, arbitrary way that things happened to have turned out. I hadnt expected Nadja to end well, but it still came as a shock when she went crazy and was committed to an insane asylum. Breton mentioned it in his usual offhand way (I was told, several months ago, that Nadja was mad....), then launched into a mordant social critique of mental institutions, of how badly they treated poor people. He said it was because he hated psychiatry so much that he had never visited or inquired after Nadja. The book went on another twenty-five pages, and didnt mention Nadja at all. Then it ended. So did she get out? How was that not something people mentioned, when they said what the book was about? I turned my copy over to reread the back cover: always a creepy experience once you had finished a book, like getting a message from a dead person. Nadja, originally published in France in 1928, is the first and perhaps best Surrealist romance ever written, it said. The Nadja of the book is a girl, but, like Bertrand Russells definition of electricity as not so much a thing as a way things happen, Nadja is not so much a person as a way she makes people behave. Just imagine being told that you werent a person, but a way you made other people behave. Well, I cant say I think much of the effect Im having on you, I would say. Thats what can happen when you fetishize an aesthetic life. It can make you irresponsible and destructive, Svetlana said later, about Andr Breton. But people like that can invent a new style, and I can appreciate that. What should he have done when he met Nadja? I asked. If he wasnt being irresponsible and destructive. She thought it over. He could have tried to be a force of stability in her life, and avoided getting romantically involved with her. I felt a pang. I hadnt wanted Ivan to be a force of stability in my life. A recurring question in the ethics seminar was how to avoid ending up at something called the Repugnant Conclusion. The Repugnant Conclusion said that it was possible to justify decreasing a populations quality of life, if you made the population bigger. It was really hard not to get there. Even if you said something inoffensive-sounding, like, I think we should do the most good for the most people, that meant that, if there were a million people whose lives were well worth living, and you had the opportunity to transform them into a billion people whose lives were barely worth living, you would be morally obligated to do it. There you were at the Repugnant Conclusion. The phrase barely worth living made a knot form in my stomach. In what country was it happening? Andr Breton was both less smart and less kind than the ethics professor. Yet, what he was talking about felt more to the point. He wasnt coming up with rules for situations with implications we couldnt think of; he was interpreting things that had really happened. The really-happenedness was advertised on every page, with photographs. The fact that Breton had left his own shitty behavior in the story was, in a way, more proof of realness. Nadja had the validity of constituting at least a tiny part of the way of the world. Part of the way of the world was that women had a tendency to go crazy. Men could bring out this tendency. But to blame the men was to take sides, to lose logic, to enter the craziness of the womenbecause the very content of the womens craziness was, in large part, the blameworthiness of the men. In Russian conversation class, Irina Nikolaevna spoke so quickly, using so many unknown words, that I rarely had any idea what she was saying. But sometimes something shone like a gold ring at the bottom of the stream, and a sentence came to me with perfect clarity. Like this one: Everything you want right now, everything you want so passionately and think youll never getyou will get it someday. I accidentally met her eyes, and it felt like she was talking to me. Yes, you will get it, she said, looking right at me, but by that time, you wont want it anymore. Thats how it happens. My mind went into overdrive. Was she talking about Ivan? How much did she know? Ivan and I had both been in her class last year. Had she seen something between us? Had he told her something? I knew that he was fond of herwe both were, we had talked about it. Were they somehow in contact? Was that the kind of thing that happened? What was the kind of thing that happened? How was she so sure that she knew what it wasthe kind of thing that happened? You wont want it anymore: was it because Tatiana rejected Eugene Onegin at the end of Eugene Onegin? Was it possible that all Russian people were constantly thinking about Eugene Onegin? Irina Nikolaevna couldnt possibly know what I wanted. And I would never not want it. PART TWO The Rest of the Fall Semester October It was the golden time of year. Every day the leaves grew brighter, the air sharper, the grass more brilliant. The sunsets seemed to expand and melt and stretch for hours, and the brick faades glowed pink, and everything blue got bluer. How many perfect autumns did a person get? Why did I seem always to be in the wrong place, listening to the wrong music? For Russian, we read a short story called Rudolfio. It was about a sixteen-year-old girl named Io, who was in love with a twenty-eight-year-old married man. Io, who was whimsical, maintained that, when she and this man, Rudolf, were together, they formed a single entity: Rudolfio. Rudolf laughed and said that Io was funny. Io talked a lot about adults: how they only paid attention to each other, treating non-adults as subhuman. Rudolf loaned Io a copy of The Little Prince that he, a grown man, had for some reason. One day, when Rudolfs wife was out, Io showed up at his house. Her breasts resembled little nests built by unknown birds to hatch their nestlings. Io asked Rudolf why he had gotten married so young, preventing them, Rudolfio, from getting married. Rudolf laughed. She was funny! Later, he felt full of some kind of inexpressible, still not revealed melancholy, that was nonetheless existent in nature. Rudolf went on a work trip without telling Io. When he got back, Rudolf wondered whether he felt too happy to see her. Did you go away and then come back? Io asked. In Russian, that was one word. The verbs of motion were by far the worst part of learning Russian. Io and Rudolf took a walk in a vacant lot full of garbage. Io asked Rudolf to kiss her. Rudolf kissed her on the cheek. On the lips, Io said. But Rudolf replied: Only the closest people kiss on the lips. Io slapped him in the face and ran away, through the garbage. Io didnt come home that night. Her mother panicked and called Rudolf. Rudolf didnt know anything. Io turned up the next afternoon, and refused to speak. Rudolf went over. He found her sitting on her bed, facing the wall, mutely rocking back and forth. He said she had to tell him at least where she had been all night. Go to hell, Io said. Rudolf nodded. Then he picked up his raincoat, turned around, and went to hell. Up to then, I hadnt been impressed by the quality of the writing, but that ending blew me away. He turned around, picked up his raincoat, and went to hell. In class, Irina Nikolaevna asked us whether Rudolf had loved Io. Everyone basically agreed that he hadnt. Maybe he loved her a little bit, said Julia. He didnt love her, said Gavriil, with certainty. He was playing games. Did Rudolf love his wife? Irina Nikolaevna asked. Gavriil said yes. Julia said maybe. Svetlana said that Rudolf was a very conventional person who was attached to the institution of marriage but hadnt given it substantial thought. Under such circumstances, she said, speaking of love might not be to the point. We learned the Russian verbs for to marry, which were different for men and for women. A man got wived on someone (prepositional case), while a woman went out husbanded after someone (accusative case). Irina Nikolaevna illustrated the difference with stick-figures. Everyone laughed at the man on the woman. We discussed the kissing scene in Rudolfiohow Io had been hurt, how Rudolf had hurt her. We discussed the difference between kissing on the cheek (prepositional singular) and on the lips (prepositional plural). Irina Nikolaevna asked each of us to describe the first time we kissed anyone on the lips. Julia said she had kissed a boy in a playground when she was nine. Gavriil said he had kissed his girlfriend at a school dance when he was eleven. Svetlana said she had kissed her cousins boyfriend in the zoo in Belgrade when she was thirteen. I said, untruthfully, that I had kissed a boy at summer camp when I was fifteen. Fifteen, Sonya? Are you sure? Irina Nikolaevna wrote 15 on the board. It turned out she thought I had to have been younger. Fifteen, I said firmly. Irina Nikolaevna asked what the boy had been like. I said he played the mandolin, inviting follow-up questions about how and where he had played the mandolin. He played the mandolin everywhereincessantly, I said. The Slavic department is so weird, Svetlana said, in the bathroom. Im feeling so much anxiety right now. I dont think when you learn other languages, you have to talk about your sexual history. Its funny because back when I was thirteen, I felt so bad about kissing my cousins boyfriend. But it really came in handy today, because if it wasnt for that, I would never have kissed anyone. I was wondering what I would have said if I hadnt kissed anyone. Then I suddenly felt really worried about you! I know you never had a boyfriend either, and I didnt remember you mentioning kissing anyone. I actually almost turned around and told you, Selin, for once in your life, just dont tell the truth, OK? But then you had mandolin boy up your sleeve! I was so relieved! Mandolin boy saved the day, I agreed, looking in the mirror at the dark circles under my eyes. My hair resembled the nest of an unknown bird prepared to hatch its nestlings. What had happened to Io, the night when she was away from home? Was it supposed to be understood that she had been raped? It felt like that was often what was supposed to be understood in short stories. In the Chance class, we read an interview with John Cage where he said that the most profound music to him now was the honking of cars on Sixth Avenue. This was because he no longer needed the structure and overbearingness of what we call music. If something is boring after two minutes, Cage wrote, try it for four... then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. I sighed. Only someone who was already old and famous could say something like thatthat some randomly occurring garbage was the greatest art form. I couldnt go around being like, Heres the sounds of Sixth Avenue. Oh, it doesnt sound interesting to you? Try it for thirty-two minutes. Nor did I want to. Baudelaire said that walking in a crowd was an art that only poets were capable of. A fairy had to have bestowed something to him in the cradle. Thats why he was able to enter freely into each mans personality. For him alone everything is vacant. If any poet tried to enter my personality like a vacant building...! I asked the I Ching if I should drop the Chance class. I got Hexagram 6: A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune. Going through to the end brings misfortune. Svetlana bought the new R.E.M. album, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, and we listened to the whole thing in her room. How amazing it was when people who sounded so distinctive did something new. What would it be like to be themto know why they were R.E.M.? One song had the line Id sooner chew my leg off: a subjective statement that nonetheless struck me as so cosmically true that I couldnt believe I had heard it correctly. Svetlana had spent the evening in Scotts room, doing some wilderness-related paperwork. They listened to folk music, sipping chardonnay, and toasting their non-sexual love for one another. Scott, I learned, had to make parts of himself die in order to be in his relationship, because Jenna didnt appreciate his music and his spirituality. What Svetlana felt for Scott, she said, wasnt a crush, but love. A crush is about building up the self, and love is about giving from the self. For love, you have to have a self youre secure with, to give to the other person. I silently absorbed the implication that what I felt for Ivan was only a crush, because I didnt have a self I was secure with. A poem in Real Change titled, incredibly, And to think, shed never been kissed. Was I losing my mind? Innocence tempted with the chance To feel the pleasures of the flesh Childhood stolen at twenty-three The minute his tongue met her breast Childhood stolen at... twenty-three? How long had that person planned to, like, treasure her childhood? Yet I filed away the mention, as I always did, of any person who had been older than nineteen when they first kissed someone. Once, I had heard a writer on NPR say that he hadnt kissed anyone until he was twenty-five. But he had been gay and born in the 1940s. The rest of the poem was about how regrets came later, but for now there was just pleasure, pain, supposed love, / And just being in his arms. What were the regrets that came later? Was it that she had thought he loved her, and then it turned out he didnt? It couldnt be that, againcould it? Was that what everything was about? Juho invited me to High Table, which was the name of the weekly dinner for his fellowship, but was also the name of the table itself: several tables, actually, lined up end-to-end, on an elevated platform. People dressed as waiters were pouring wine. Some of the professors and tutors wore black robes. I couldnt believe stuff like this still went on, and in America: people in black robes sitting at a table that was like eight inches higher than the rest of the room, calling it High Table. I realized that I had based my idea of the other fellows in the society on Juho himself, assuming that they would in some way resemble him. This was not the case. He was clearly the youngest, by several years. His green jogging suit was unlike anything anyone else was wearing. One black-robed tutor, addressing him as Yoo-hoo, asked in a forced, jovial tone, when Juho had last shaved. Juho said that he couldnt be certain but he thought it had been a Tuesday. It was in some way to defend Juho that I made a special effort to talk to the other fellows, to ask about their projectsto prove that Juho and I inhabited the world as fully, and spoke about it as fluently, as anyone else there, and were just as entitled to an accounting of other peoples activities. The woman across from me said that she was trying to use a computer model of an extinct flute to reconstruct the music that had played during tragedies in Ancient Greece. Tragic verse and music were inseparable for the Greeks, but today we have no idea what the music sounded like, she said, speaking with a British accent. What do you think it sounded like? I was conscious of speaking in almost a flirtatious way, like Ivan would have. She had to be at least ten years older than me, but there was a hint of a smile or a spark in her eye that I sensedor sensed that Ivan would have sensedas some kind of potential. I think it sounded terrifying, she said. I wanted to talk to her more, to find out more about her, but the guy next to her kept interrupting with a point he was trying to make about the area that a cow would graze if it was tied to a movable fence. I sawed at a piece of grilled asparagus. Didnt the very essence of a fence reside in the fact that it was stationary? Riley had been to the SPCA, in an effort to procure a cat. Popular opinion held that a cat could be more easily concealed in overflow housing than in a regular dorm. I had never had a cat, didnt understand the point of cats, and had had a negative childhood experience with a dog. I was 60 percent sure that dog had ended up euthanized. Furthermore, I already had a troubling sense of being surrounded at all times by foreign intelligences. For these reasons, I felt no need to add any more sentient beings to our household. But Priya, Joanne, and especially Riley loved cats, and their love was more powerful than my indifference. As it turned out, the SPCA wouldnt give you a cat unless you had a signed form from your landlord, stating that pets were allowed in your building. That was a problem, because pets werent allowed in our building. Riley had a plan to get the form signed by one of the resident tutors, who she thought had a secret cat. The plan somehow backfired. After that, the tutor no longer returned our greetings in the hallway. The radio in the Quincy kitchen was playing the new Alanis Morissette single, Head over Feet. It was about having the maturity to want something good for you. I felt outraged. I had thought Alanis Morissette was there to remind us. Now she was marveling at how healthy she felt, now that she had the ability to want something rational. It was clear that the rational thing she wanted was some boring guy. You mean heels. I didnt realize I had said it out loud until Svetlana patted my arm. There, there, she said soothingly. Head over feet is, like, the customary way people are. Its the way of bipedalism. Well, Selin, I think that the problem-free grasp of idiomatic language isnt what we go to Alanis Morissette for. We usually ate lunch in one of the meeting rooms off of the main dining hallthe smallest one, which was often empty. One wall was completely covered by a Mercator map of the world. Everything in the Arctic Circle was hugely magnified and prominent, like someones giant grotesque forehead. The effect was especially pronounced on Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya. We put down our trays and immediately started debating which poet we liked better: Anna Akhmatova or Marina Tsvetaeva. They were the most famous Russian women poets. Svetlana said she liked Tsvetaeva: objectively the cooler choice. I felt more similar to Akhmatova, so I defended her, but I wasnt happy about it. Scott had invited Svetlana to a Halloween party and she couldnt decide what to go as. Sometimes, in the course of normal life, she wore her hair in two braids, and it made her look really different in a cute way, so that was a possible avenue. Svetlana said she was worried about infantilizing herself. I tried to think of a competent, iconic person who had two braids. Maybe like a Valkyrie with a Viking hat? From the opera? I dont know... that might make me feel fat, Svetlana said, composing a forkful of cottage cheese and raw broccoli. One month into her diet, her face already seemed longer and more sculpted, her eyes more glittery. The longer we talked about it, the more the Halloween costume seemed like a trap. If she went as anything that could be construed as sexy, Scott might tease her. But if she deliberately desexualized herself, that was also a kind of abasement. Anna Akhmatova had a nose similar to mine. Her name was a pen name; she believed her great-grandmother was a descendant of a fifteenth-century khan named Akhmat. She became famous from writing a poem about pulling the left-hand glove onto her right hand. She wrote about partings and last words. One poem was called Today No Letter Was Delivered to Me. Sometimes she wrote about him or my husband. Her real-life husband, also a famous poet, tried to kill himself. They suffered and got a divorce. Later, he was executed. Their son was arrested. Akhmatova joined the mass of mothers and wives waiting outside the prison gates, and wrote Requiem: a political poem that circulated in samizdat and was considered to be a stark departure from her love lyrics. It, too, was full of stylized womanly suffering. At the end, she compared herself to Mary at the Crucifixion: where the Mother stood in silence / nobody even dared look. Anything about suffering mothers gave me an oppressed feeling. How many times a day do you and Selin see each other? Riley asked, the third time Svetlana and I ran into her on our way to and from each others rooms. Do you think its weird that we spend so much time together? Svetlana asked me afterward. Its almost like were in a relationship. Hm... I said, stalling. Werent we in a relationship? This is how much time I would expect to spend with a boyfriend, Svetlana clarified. Oh, right, I said. Valeries older brother, who had just finished a math Ph.D. and now worked for the CIA, was coming to visit. Svetlana said she was going to figure out from him what the deal was with Ivan. What? No, dont do that, I said. Selin, we need to find out the truth. And you know all the math people know each other. He wont know anything useful, and if he did he wouldnt tell you. Hell just tell Ivan were investigating him. Dont worry, Ill be very subtle. No, just dont. We were headed to the language lab to watch a movie called Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears. Riley had thought the title was a joke, but it was really called that. It was about two girls who lived in a dormitory: a spunky blonde who was always thinking up schemes to catch rich husbands, and a tragic brunette who worked in a factory and wanted to become an engineer. The movie followed them for twenty years. At some point the brunette, now in her forties, successful but alone, was on the metro, dressed in the crappy clothes she had worn to help someone renovate their dacha. A mechanic on the metro mistook her for a factory worker, and fell in love with her. Then, all her problems were overuntil the mechanic found out she was actually an engineer. Then he got angry, ostensibly because she had deceived him, but really because he thought that men had to earn more than women. She looked at him, with her face full of different expressions, and instead of explaining all the reasons she was right, simply said: Forgive me. There was something so exciting about how submissively she said ithow different it was from if she had protested and reasoned. And it worked: he forgave her, in a way that was somehow intensely sexual, even though she was an attractive woman, and he looked like a pedantic thuggish elf. I was filled with the desire to say that to Ivan, and for him to forgive me. Daylight Savings ended. Crossing the Quincy quad one afternoon, I made out what looked like four big light-colored stones. Then two of them stood up, trailing white tassels, and turned out to be Svetlanas blockmates, Danny and Josh. Hey, Selin! Were you planning on going into the building? Josh asked in a weird, casual tone. I felt all four of the guys looking at me. How could they all have gotten locked out at once? Then I saw that Josh was actually holding his ID card toward me, and I remembered it was Friday and they didnt use electricity. Oh, definitely, I said, swiping his card. The light turned green and I held open the door. For about the hundredth time, I felt impressed by how many different rules there were that a person could follow. This particular rule seemed pretty pointless, but maybe those guys knew something I didnt. They were talking cheerfully enough among themselves in the hallway, and the one whose name I didnt know called over his shoulder, Thanks, Selin! Riley was sitting at the table in the common room putting on Chanel Vamp nail polish. Priya was doing a shoulder stand on the floor, while reading aloud from an expensive juniors clothing catalog that had been mailed to her by mistake. It was full of pictures of thirteen-year-old models posing sassily in three-hundred-dollar jumpers with daisies on the pockets. Priya was making fun of it, but it became clear that she was also planning to order a shirt. Riley asked me to help her put the nail polish on her right hand. I felt pleased, because she so rarely asked for any kind of assistance. And right after I got to help some religious people open a door! Its hard to not get it in the crevasse, Riley said, about the place where the side of the nail met the finger. I had never heard the word crevasse used in that way. Moscow does not believe in tears, I told her, but I folded up a napkin and managed to get the nail polish out of the crevasse. I told Riley and Priya about how Svetlanas blockmates had been sitting outside in the dark because they couldnt use a card reader after sundown. Priya said that once, in the Science Center, a random guy she had never seen before had yelled at her for not knowing that she was the one who had to call the elevator. Was that a Friday, though? I think that guy was just an asshole. That is another one of the worlds major religions. I said it didnt seem logical that a person should be prohibited from telling an elevator to come, but allowed to tell someone else to tell an elevator to come. Its not an argument you want to get intobelieve me, Riley said. All they do in high school is debate this stuff. Theyll cream you. Apparently, Morris had asked an observant guy in their math section why he felt OK with sitting in a room with the lights on but not with turning on the lights himself. Over the next twenty minutes, the guy had proceeded to logically dismantle everything Morris said and thought and believed. Morris hadnt known what had hit him. I mean, I did Model UN, he kept saying afterward. I couldnt help thinking it was wasteful for people with such good logic skills to spend so many years and so much energy learning to reconcile an old book with the way things were now. Couldnt a person just write a new book? Joanne had just biked fifty miles to Lowell, Massachusetts, and back. Is there anything special in Lowell? Riley asked. Joanne looked thoughtful. There probably is, she said, hanging her bike on its special rack. Riley had given up on the SPCA and joined a Usenet group. I wasnt sure what that was, but it seemed to have connected her to the kind of people who often had a cat or two to unload, and werent too picky about paperwork. Take this one guy, who crossbred domestic cats with servals. The servals had to be fed whole live prey, so that was a no, but just as an example. Riley was explaining to me about the servals at lunch when our friend Jeremy asked if he could sit with us. Were about to leave, Riley said, though we had barely sat down. Jeremy pulled up a chair anyway, and started enthusing about Gravitys Rainbow. Riley pushed back her chair. I have lab, she said. Selin, dont you have a Russian thing? I had just taken an enormous bite of peanut-butter sandwich. I wasnt like Riley, who always seemed able to leave a meal at any point, regardless of how much she had or hadnt eaten. Pushkin said that was the greatest good fortune: being able to leave the table before the wine was drained from the chalice. Not me; I was eating my sandwich. Riley lingered a moment, looking concerned, then left. Jeremy segued to his other favorite topic, after Thomas Pynchon: his love for two girls named Diane. It was a subject I had never discouraged in the past, because I felt flattered that he was confiding in me, and because I thought it would be more interesting than listening to some random guy list all the famous professors he had taken classes with, which was another thing that often befell a person in the cafeteria. And yetit somehow wasnt more interesting. The stories went on and on, full of details and coincidences. I didnt know Diane W., but was acquainted with Diane H., who wore hoop earrings, tiered skirts, and Converse high-tops. Riley had once remarked of her, in an ironic voice, that she had had sex with four different guys we knew, including this one guy Ronnie, who sometimes lied about having read books when he hadnt. Riley was a feminist, so I knew that the reason she spoke ironically about Diane wasnt that she thought she was a slut. It was more complicated, and related to self-respect. When I got back to our room, Riley was exchanging messages with a woman in Dorchester, whose obese Norwegian Forest Cat had sat, with near-lethal results, on her newborn baby. If Riley played her cards right, that could someday be our cat. For my science Core class, I had to watch a movie about black holes. A theoretical physicist was explaining how we knew that black holes existed, even though we couldnt see them. Have you ever been to a ball? he asked, speaking in a fond, sentimental voice. Have you ever watched the young men dressed in their black evening tuxedos and the girls in their white dresses, whirling around in each others arms, and the lights turn low and all you can see is the girls? I hadnt been to a ball, or to any formal dance. It was simultaneously disturbing and reassuring to hear the absolute, essential nature of this experience confirmed in cosmological terms. The physicist said that the girl was an ordinary star, and the boy was a black hole. You couldnt see the boy, but the girl whirling around him was evidence that he existed, and was holding her in orbit. This seemed like corroboration of The Seducers Diary, where the seducer disappeared and Cordelia was going in circles. It seemed to me that the elements whirling around me in my own life were also somehow held in place by Ivans absence, or were there because of himto counterbalance a void. Riley showed me how to use the talk command on Unix. All you had to do was type talk, followed by the persons email address. If they accepted, the screen split horizontally. What you typed appeared in the top, and what they typed was in the bottom. You could see each other typing, thinking, backspacing. You could delete what you had just written and write something elsethat could be a form of joke. You could adopt the persona of someone who had displaced you by violent means, or you could pretend to be your own computer that had just achieved sentience. When I tried typing talk and Ivans Berkeley address, I got an error message. Svetlana had interrogated Valeries brother. Valeries brother had been in some graduate math classes with Ivan. He said he seemed like a nice guy. Svetlana explained her mothers theory that Ivan was the devil incarnate. I dont know anything about that, the brother said. I emailed Ivan asking if we could do Unix talk. He wrote back saying that, although in principle he would like to talk to me, nonetheless in practical terms, not all the networks could connect to each other, and he wasnt sure it was possible in our case. Moreover, he didnt know if I was someone he could talk to right now, because he didnt know who I was. It is like there are many Selins and I dont know which one I will get. What if I meet the one who sees me as the devil? I tried to write Ivan an email explaining what had happened: why Svetlanas mother had said he was the devil incarnate, how it was partly because of how he had appeared on the airplane to Paris, frightening me and Svetlana, and partly because of Svetlanas mothers attitude toward me, how she insisted on seeing me as a pathetic person, possibly because she was angry at the Ottoman occupation of Serbia, but also because she was envious of Svetlana and thus somehow envious of me; and why Svetlana might have elected to run her mothers remark by Valeries brother, even though I had asked her not to. The thing with me and Ivan, I realized, had been hard, in its way, on Svetlana, had put stress on her project of self-improvement, and on her interaction with this guy, Scott. Trying to explain all the steps was boring and exhausting. I kept imagining Ivan getting bored, or not believing me, and it kept sounding like I was putting the blame on other people, like Svetlana and her mom. When I tried to put the blame on myself, it was also tedious and boring, and in the end I gave up trying to explain anything. This is mortifying, Svetlana said in the scalp care section of the CVS, picking up a delousing kit. Halloween wasnt until next Thursday, but Scotts party had already happened. Svetlana ended up going as herself, having concluded that costumes were, on some level, opposed to human dignity. As a resultor perhaps coincidentallya drunk person had clapped some kind of vintage hat on her head. At least three other people at the party had also gotten lice. It occurred to me, not for the first time, how much simpler our lives would be if we could date each other. That delousing kit cost eleven dollars! Do you ever think it would be easier if we could go out with girls? I said aloud. Svetlana didnt answer right away. I find most of the lesbians I know a bit intimidating, she said, finally. And I dont really share their aesthetic senseor they seem not to value aesthetics that much. I just dont think Id fit in. Especially since Im always lusting after boys. That was something I thought about, too: the physical response I felt to Ivan, the dull electric jolt, some heavy, slow machinery starting to turn in my chest and between my legs. I had never felt those things with relation to a girl. On the other hand, I usually hadnt felt them in Ivans presence, either; it was more when he wasnt there. And how much was that physical feeling worth? Was it really enough to counterbalance all the disadvantages? You couldnt just talk to Ivan like he was a normal person; he didnt hear, or he didnt understand, or he went off somewhere and you couldnt find him. Also, all his friends thought I was crazy. Instead of dealing with those people, how much more fun and relaxing it would be to pet Svetlanas shining golden hair, to tell her how pretty she was and to watch her get more pretty, as she always did when someone complimented her. Her body wanted to be complimented, and I knew just what to tell her, so why couldnt I? But girls are more beautiful, and so much easier to sort of negotiate with. And the lust for boys never seems to work out well for me. So it just feels like girls are at least something to think about. Again, Svetlana didnt answer right away. I would feel squeamish with anything beyond kissing and playing with each others breasts, she said after a moment. I realized that I, too, had only been thinking about kissing and playing with each others breasts. What else did lesbians even do? Other than oral sex, which was apparently horrible. The way people talked about it on sit-coms: Does he like... deep-sea diving? You had to be altruistic to do ita generous lover. That said, oral sex with a boy also seemed likely to be disgusting. Guys themselves seemed to think so. Wasnt that why they went around yelling cocksucker at people who cut them off in traffic? Do you not feel squeamish when you think about sex with a guy? I asked. I do, but it feels exciting. The idea of being penetrated and dominated. I recognized that the idea of being penetrated and dominated was exciting to me, too, though the mechanics, as well as the implications, were unclear and troubling. Also, why did we have to be excited by that? Why couldnt we be excited about something else? But I knew I was being childish and unrealistic, and Svetlana was right. Love wasnt a slumber party with your best friend. Love was dangerous, violent, with an element of something repulsive; attraction had a permeable border with repulsion. Love had death in it, and madness. To try to escape those things was immature and anti-novelistic. Do you keep hearing that noise? Riley asked. We were both up late studying. No, I said. Riley paused her CD player. That, she said. I still didnt hear anything. We had been listening to Criminal by Fiona Apple: Rileys favorite song. I got the sense that Riley thought that she was a criminal. I wasnt sure why. I couldnt see that she had done anything wrong. She had, however, gone to Catholic school. I went back to reading Fear and Trembling for tutorial. Then Riley and I looked up at the same time: I had heard it, too. Riley pushed back her chair and went to investigate. Selin, Riley called, from the hallway. Its for you. I went out to join her. Hello, said Juho, who was standing on the cat-themed doormat. I saw that your lights were on, so I thought I would knock at your door. But I decided to space the knocks very far apart, and then decrease the interval, to see how close the knocks have to be together, before they are perceived as knocking. Riley gave me a look. Ill be inside, she said. There was nowhere to talk in the apartment: Riley was studying in the bedroom, and Joanne was asleep in the common room. I grabbed my coat and headed to the stairwell. Juho followed me down to the lobby, at which point I noticed that his pants had a giant hole in one knee. Blood was running down his leg. I went back upstairs for disinfectant and a Band-Aid. When I returned, Juho was sitting outside on the steps with his head tilted all the way back. That was when I understood that he was drunk. He rolled up the leg of his dress pantsthe green sweatpants had been prohibited from High Tablebut didnt seem to know what to do with the Band-Aid, and kept turning it over in his hands. He said he had been misinformed about the alcohol content of port. I put the Band-Aid on his leg myself, after dabbing the cut with alcohol. It must have stung, but he didnt say anything. Juho explained the experimental protocol he had devised, about the door. He had knocked once, and then waited thirty seconds. Then he knocked again, and waited twenty-five seconds. He kept reducing the interval by five-second increments, until he got to fifteen. Then he went down by one-second increments. Riley had shown up when the knocks were twelve seconds apart. I was surprised by this result, he said. I did not think that knocks that are twelve seconds apart will be perceived as knocking. I said I didnt think Riley had perceived it as knocking. Ah, he said, a little sadly. Then perhaps the experiment has been inconclusive. I remembered that that was why he was here: to research, to do experiments. It was interesting to think that Harvard had underwritten the studies in knocking-perception that he had conducted on our door. What a stressful fellowship: how did a person know what to do? For the first time it occurred to me that maybe Juho didnt know; that maybe he was just like me, only even more so, wandering around the world in his institutionally non-sanctioned pants, incorrectly knocking on doors. But then I remembered that he had Ph.D.s in both chemistry and physics, meaning that he had some body of knowledge and accomplishment that I couldnt imagine having, and must be using it to make choices I didnt understand, either. When I looked over at him, he was staring at the sky with his usual peaceful expressionswaying slightly, but not seeming especially bothered by anything. Fear and Trembling was about how Abraham was the greatest and most interesting person in human history, because when God told Abraham to go up to the top of some mountain and kill his son... well, Abraham immediately saddled up the donkeys. Kierkegaard speculated about how awkward the trip would have beenabout what Abraham and Isaac could possibly have talked about. Kierkegaard had published Fear and Trembling in 1843, the same year as Either/Or, under the name Johannes de silentio. De silentio meant of silence. That was because the subject defied language, because it was so unsayable and paradoxical that Abraham had agreed to kill his own son. Abraham couldnt tell anyone anything. Nobody would have understood, or believed him about God, or believed that he didnt secretly want to kill his son. In tutorial, we learned that Fear and Trembling illustrated the teleological suspension of the ethical. Judith clearly liked this phrase. But what do we think about this teleological suspension of the ethical? she kept saying. Teleological suspension of the ethical meant that it was OK to murder your kid, if God told you to. It meant believing that God loved you, even if he acted like he didnt; and believing that you loved your own kid, even if you acted like you didnt. After all, if everyones behavior was visibly consistent with what their attitude was supposed to be, then faith would be unnecessary. Why were religious people so obsessed with killing their own kids? At dinner, Morris described a debate his Moral Reasoning class had had about Kants categorical imperative. The idea of the categorical imperative was that moral rules were universal, with no exceptions. Lying, for example, was wrongalways, for everyone, under all circumstances. But what if an axe murderer knocked at your door and said, Hello, sir, may I know where your children are so that I can murder them? Were you morally justified to lie? Someone had actually asked Kant that, and Kant had said no. Morriss Moral Reasoning section had debated it for the whole hour. I didnt see the point of debating how I would respond to an axe murderer saying something that an axe murder would literally never say. More broadly, I mistrusted the project of trying to generalize a set of rules that would work in all circumstances. Surely, whatever rule anyone thought of, there would be some situations where it wouldnt work. I myself had often had the experience of being prevented, by my life situation, from following some rule that made sense for everyone else. When I explained it, people would laugh and say, How could we have thought of that? Riley came back from Dorchester with a gigantic duffel bag containing Stanley: all twenty-six pounds of him. This was the culmination of a week of phone negotiations with Stanleys owner, Barbara, who had a neurological condition where she sometimes involuntarily said the word speedboat. Stanley was nine years old, neutered and declawed. He had terrible balance. Walking slowly and unenthusiastically around the apartment, he reminded me of a certain old man we had had to visit for some reason in Adana, who didnt reply when spoken to and barely seemed to register anything anyone said, including on the TV that was always on in the background. Stanley gave me the same bleak feelinglike whatever vitality had once been inside him had been snuffed out a long time ago. On the other hand, it was possible that Stanley did enjoy sitting on things, like keys and ID cards (and, as Riley pointed out, babies), because he seemed to go slightly out of his way to do it. Stanleys most problematic feature was his habit of defecating on the carpet directly next to the litter box. Riley got a larger box and put it over the piece of carpet he favored. Once there was a box there, he shifted a few inches farther to the right. Moscow does not believe in tears, Riley said, and got out the carpet powder. Priya started lighting incense to cover up the smell, creating the dense miasma of sandalwood and cat excreta that became characteristic of our apartment. Dont even get me started on Fear and Trembling, Svetlana said. That book literally gave me a nervous breakdown freshman year. Really? I didnt leave my room for a week. Valerie and Hedge brought me little bowls of food from the cafeteria. They must have thought I was a total freak. Where was I? Why didnt I bring you little bowls of food? I dont remember. I felt really embarrassed about it. I probably felt too embarrassed to tell you, because I thought youd think I was being self-important or lame. Thats probably the worst part of having a Kierkegaard-related nervous breakdown. The person Svetlana had eventually been able to talk to about Fear and Trembling had been Dave, whose preschool had featured a giant mural of Abraham about to murder Isaac, so he had been thinking about this stuff for years. What kind of fucked-up preschool was that? I almost asked, before reflecting that such remarks were what made people not feel comfortable telling me about their Kierkegaard-related nervous breakdowns. The black screen of my computer was filled up with green lines of text. Like fertile fields, like money, like the light that said go. Message from TalkDaemon@playfair.stanford.edu at 20:54 talk: connection requested by ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu respond with: talk ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu Message from TalkDaemon@playfair.stanford.edu at 20:58 talk: connection requested by ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu respond with: talk ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu Message from TalkDaemon@playfair.stanford.edu at 21:01 talk: connection requested by ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu respond with: talk ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu It had to be Ivan trying to talk to me, from a Stanford email address. I knew he had had a summer job in a lab at Stanford once. The last request had come in almost an hour earlier. I hurriedly sat down and typed, talk ivanvar@playfair.stanford.edu. The computer thought about it a few seconds, then said: [Your party is not logged on.] I hastily emailed Ivan: Can we try again? There was no reply. Not that day, or the next. On Saturday I woke up late. The first thing I did was check my email and finger Ivans Stanford account. I didnt seriously think he would be logged on, since it wasnt even nine yet in California. But the computer started disgorging lines of text. He was using the account right now. I requested a talk connection. One by one, new lines appeared on the screen. [No connection yet] [Waiting for your party to respond] [Waiting for your party to respond] [Connection established] The screen split in two. My heart was pounding faster than the blinking cursor. I typed: > Hello And he replied: >> hello Happiness swept over me. Enemies didnt say hello. We were talking! There was a long pause, and then he typed: >> who are you? My heart seized up with fear, because it was as if he didnt know me, and everything had been erased, and nothing had been realbut then I remembered how he had written that he felt like there were many Selins, and I understood that he was asking which one he was talking to, and this filled me with a feeling of lightness and freedom, because he was letting me choosehe was asking me to choose. I typed: > I am the soul in limbo. There was a long pause. >> do i know you? I wondered how to answer. The cursor blinked implacably. > Im not sure. Another pause. >> why dont you want to tell me who you are? > I do want to tell you. >> who are you? > Dont you know I would tell you if I could? Pause. >> who are you trying to talk to? > To YOU. Not sure why it has to be so difficult >> who do you think i am? I wondered whether there was some way to tell him that the question came down to whom he haunted. More words appeared on the screen: >> are you trying to talk to ivan? I felt a sickening lurch. I typed: > who is this? The person replied: >> are you celine? I thought I was going to throw up. > yes im selin. im trying to talk to ivan. who is this? >> my name is zita. >> ivan has 2 email accounts so he let me use this one There was a knock on the doorframe and Riley came in. I felt so relieved to see her. Ive been doing Unix talk with someone for ten minutes and thought it was Ivan, but it turned out its his ex-girlfriend! I said. Wait, what? She had been outdoorsthere was a cushion of fall air around her. Like, he left his account open, and she just started using it? No, he has two email accounts, one at Berkeley and one at Stanford, and I think he gave her the Stanford one. So I was like talk to Ivan at this Stanford address, and it connected me, but the person I was talking to was her. He gave her his account? He gave her the password? Why? I dont know. I guess after they graduated she didnt have an email address anymore. Riley had come to pick up a sweater and was standing there with just her arms in the sleeves. So now shes using her exs account and he can read her emails whenever he wants? I dont know if he can read them. Maybe she changed the password. Riley closed her eyes with a pained expression. Have these people not heard of Hotmail? She put on the sweater and came over to my desk. How did you talk for ten minutes without noticing it wasnt him? Was she pretending to be him? She wasnt pretending, I said. She was like Who are you. But I thought it was a metaphysical question. The soul in limbo? Riley read over my shoulder. Its from a book, I said defensively. Zita started typing again. >> are you still there? I hastily typed: > whoops! sorry to bother you! this is very embarrassing. I could feel Riley disapproving behind me. She was right, I knew I shouldnt be apologizing. Want to come to brunch? Riley said. Oak and Lucas are downstairs. New words appeared on the screen: >> ivan talked about you a lot, so i almost feel i know you. he was so excited when he met you. You guys go ahead, I told Riley. Ill probably be another few minutes. Well, I guess the soul in limbo knows best. I could hear her furrowing her eyebrows. And then I felt that she was gone. >> i was actually wanting to talk to you. i thought i could explain some things about ivan. > like what >> i got the impression through peter that things are looking dark for you now. i think i know a bit what youre going through. i think i can help you to see more clearly. I sat there for a while staring at the cursor, wondering whether cursor was related to a curse, and who had called it a talk daemon. Then Zita was typing again: >> would you be open to talking on the phone? i am not so fast a typist as you. I imagined typing, I have to go, and going to brunch. They wouldnt have sat down yet. Lucas would be waiting forever for a bagel to come out of the toaster. Oak would overfill the waffle iron and end up with a cauliflower-shaped waffle. Riley would make a correct waffle, eat two bites, and leave the rest. One thing Riley had in common with Svetlana, and also, come to think of it, literally every other person I knew, was that she would advise me not to talk to Zita on the phone. I see zero potential advantage in this conversation, I imagined my mother saying. I knew that she, like Riley, would find it strange and suspicious that Zita should be using Ivans email address, and would be unable to conceive of any reason other than malice or insanity that she, Ivans ex-girlfriend, should want to talk to me. In fairness, I, too, had difficulty imagining what the reason could be. But that didnt mean it didnt exist. Why was it that ones female relatives always said that, when a woman said or did anything inexplicablethat it was because of jealousy? If you pointed out, But I, or you, did practically the same thing once, and we werent jealous, they would say: Were different from other people. This was true of women on my mothers side of the family, on my fathers side of the family, and on my stepmothers side of the family: three different families, with otherwise different ways of looking at things. Yet they all thought that they were the only ones who werent motivated by jealousy. Surely that meant that there were people all over who werent motivated by jealousy. Why shouldnt Zita be one of them? After all, Ivan had liked her. Anyway, even though all the women I could think ofRiley, Svetlana, my relativeshad, between them, lived a multitude of different lives and covered a lot of human experiences, they hadnt ever been in a situation just like this one. Even as I was having these thoughts, I knew they were theoretical, because I was already definitely going to talk to Zita. When, on what basis had this decision been reached? I typed my phone number and hit return. Selin? This is Zita. She had a slight accent. Her voice sounded younger than Id been expecting. Hey, I said. We both started laughing. We confirmed to each other that it was weird we were having this conversation, that our Unix session had been weird. This was a comfort. I realized that I had expected Zita to be like Ivan and Peter, because she knew them, and was their age, and was also probably Hungarian, but once we were talking I felt that her worldview and feelings were more aligned with mine than with theirs, because we were girls. For example, when something was weird, we were able to say so, and it felt a little less weird. So, she said. So, I said. Ive really wanted to talk to you. Peter told me you were really upset with Ivan, and I think I understand. When Ivan told me about you last year, he was so excited. But I was a little worried, because I know how he can be. I wondered whether Zita was going to try to impress me with how much better she knew Ivanhow she had always been watching from afar, worrying that I would be hurt. At some point Ivan had asked Zita for a womans perspective. If I ask someone for coffee, does it mean I like them, or only as a friend? If we go swimming, does it mean I like them, or only as a friend? When he said he wanted to take me to Walden Pond on his motorcycle, she was worried, because she knew how romantic that was and how it would seem to me. He said I didnt understand, that it wasnt like that with you. But afterwards he said, Zita, maybe you were right. Zita said she wanted to help me. She wanted to help me understand. To help me understand, Zita told me the story of her relationship with Ivan. Zita and Ivan had met in freshman year, at an orientation program for international students. Ivan had been to a special math high school, the kids there were very bright but didnt necessarily have great social skills. He had never had a girlfriend. Zita was differentvery social, with a lot of boyfriends and friends, always getting involved. Already as a little girl she had been called an advocate, a social worker, she defended the weak, even when it meant picking a fight. It had been natural to her to help Ivan, who had seemed lost at Harvard. I wouldnt have recognized him. Zita was a year older than he was, so she was always taking the lead. But things changed so fast in college. By the summer after sophomore year, their dynamic was different. She felt constrained. The thing that constrained her was Ivans intellectual certainty, the way he already knew, and had known since childhood, that he would become a mathematician. Zita wasnt like that. She was artistic, and liked to explore. She got really into Buddhism. She was at the divinity school now, studying Buddhism: thats why she didnt have her own email account. It wasnt clear to me whether nobody at divinity school had email, or whether it was only the ones studying Buddhism. In junior year, Zita got a grant to study in Thailand. Ivan didnt want her to go. We had a fight, she said proudly. She wound up at a temple north of Bangkok, getting up before dawn, meditating most of the day. For the first time in a year, maybe longer, she felt truly free. Meanwhile at Harvard, Ivan had started spending more time with Peter, who introduced him to Eunice. Peter and Eunice were both grad students. Peter was studying economics and Korean, and Eunice had been his Korean instructor. Ivan and Eunice saw each other a few times with Peter. One day they met in the street and ended up having coffee and talking for three hours. They began to meet regularly, having passionate conversations about politics and history. There was an intellectual spark between them that hadnt existed with Zita. Im very smart, in my own way, Zita said, but Im emotional more than intellectual. I care more about people and feelings than about ideas. With Ivan, we always talked about what I cared about, not what he cared about. I dont think I was very patient with him. After a moment she added, casually, What were your conversations with Ivan like? Were they intellectual? I thought about my conversations with Ivan. I dont know, I said. I dont think so. But they must have been, she said. I didnt know what to say so I just sat there until she started talking again. Over spring break, Ivan had visited Zita in Thailand. They traveled to the south. She found a hut on the beach, for a few dollars a night. They could see the stars through the palm roof. Ivan and Zita had always told each other everything, so of course he told her all about Eunice. Zita didnt know how to feel. After all, the break had been her idea. She told Ivan she still loved him, and he said he still loved her, too. She knew he would give Eunice up if she asked him to. But then, he would always wonder. Zita told him he should follow his feelings, the way she had followed her impulse to go to Thailand. Ivan said he didnt know what his feelings were, or where they would lead. They agreed that this was the nature of feelings, and then they had sex in the hut in total darkness, listening to the crashing waves. At the end of the break, Zita went back to the temple, and Ivan went back to Boston. Ivan wasnt sure if he was attracted to Eunice romantically or only intellectually. They had long, challenging conversations about history and abstract ideas. Then, the junior class had a formal dance on a bridge at sunrise, with an orchestra. Ivan invited Eunice. Their hands touched, and then they kissed. Zitas voice, as she told me these things, sounded affectionate or conspiratorial. He fell in love, she said. The next time Zita saw Ivan was over the summer, when they were both in Hungary. Ivan picked her up from the airport, in a car with his mother and all his sisters. The car was so crowded that Zita sat on Ivans lap. Im very small, Zita explained. Ivans mother thought Zita shouldnt be sitting on Ivans lap now, but Zita and Ivan laughed. The whole time they were in Budapest, they saw each other every day, like they always had, and Zita spent time with his mother and sisters, whom she loved. My family isnt like thatwere all split apart. But I am a very affectionate person. Ivan and Zita discussed the nature of love. Ivan asked Zita if she thought you could be in love with two people at the same time. Zita said she didnt knowmaybe you could. Later, Ivan asked Eunice the same question. Eunice said: No. Zita spent the rest of the summer in Thailand, then flew straight to Boston in September. It was terrible to return from Bangkok to Bostonto such austerity and grayness and strivingand without Ivan, who was now getting serious about Eunice. In Budapest, everything had seemed possible. In Boston, this was not the case. Zita realized that Ivan had to choose. She told him that she had been wrongthat she needed him. Eunice became insecure and struck out at Ivan. All three of them were in hell. At that point I heard the call-waiting tone. Zita, who couldnt hear anything, said that the situation might have been the hardest on Eunice. She wasnt a bad person, but was so highly driven, competitive, sure of what she wanted and how to get it. I recognized the way non-Asian women talked about Asian women. Zita seemed to think I was more like her than I was like Eunice. Was that because Zita and I werent Asian, or because Zita and I were the ones who hadnt ended up with Ivan? Something about the call-waiting tone sounded particularly insistent. I told Zita I would be right back, and pressed the receiver button. Selin? It took me a second to place her: my own mother. Hey! Can I call you back? Im on the other line. Im in the hospital, my mother said, in a voice full of outrage and distress, and started to cry. I just had my surgery. I pressed the button again and told Zita that I had to go; my mother was calling from a hospital. Oh my goodness, right now? You must be so worried! Is she all right? Whats the matter? I dont know, I said. Id better go talk to her. Yes, of course. We can finish our conversation later. Ill leave you my number. You can call me anytime. Really, anytime, Selin. I wrote down her number. My mother had just had a double mastectomy. She hadnt told me she had breast cancer. At some point she had mentioned a cyst, and the cyst had been a sort of allegory. She hadnt meant to tell me the truth. She was telling me now because she was relieved that the surgery had gone well. It sounded like the drugs hadnt worn off yet. When I was ten, my fathers sister in Turkey had also had breast cancer, and had moved in with my father and me, in New Jersey. That had been right at the time when my mother moved out. I thought about my mother going to the doctor alone, getting the diagnosis alone, and going to surgery alone. I told her I would go back to New Jersey and stay with her. But she said emphatically that I couldnt miss school. My aunt was going to stay with her. I felt relieved. Then I felt guilty for feeling relieved. We talked for another ten minutes, until she said she felt tired. It was past one in the afternoon and I was still wearing a nightgown. I made myself take a shower and wear clothes. Then it was two. Zita picked up on the second ring. Oh, Im so happy you called. I was worried you wouldnt. How is your mother? Well, it turns out she has cancer. As soon as I said it, I wanted to take it back. Zita asked a lot of questions about the diagnosis and treatment, whether my mother had been tested for the breast cancer gene, and when I was going to go home. Its fine, I said. Shes a doctor, shes a medical professor, so shes going to do a new hormone treatment, and my aunt is going to go stay with her. Oh, good, Zita said, still sounding anxious. Do you want to finish telling me your story? Do you really want to hear about it now? Yeah. Well... where were we? It was really sad. You came back from Thailand and missed Ivan, and Eunice was a competitive person. Ohyou know, I dont want to say anything negative about Eunice. She was in a very tough situation. She was angry with me, but I was never angry with her. But for a while it was very tense. Ivan had made a decision to be with Eunice, but now that he saw Zita suffering, he wanted to be there for her. That was the kind of person he was. But Eunice said he had to choose. For one day, Zita had thought Ivan was going to choose her. Ivans mother had come to visit, and Eunice was cooking dinner for them. They were all in the kitchen, drinking wineIvan and his mother and Eunice. Then, Ivan had gone into the bedroom and telephoned Zita. While she was cooking for his mother, Zita said, with a hint of satisfaction. Zita had gone through a period of not thinking clearly. Thats why she thought she understood how I felt. She had been the same way in the spring. She had discussed the situation endlessly with her girlfriends and Peter, and had interrogated Ivans math friends (you can imagine how well that went). She realized now she had been trying on some level to win Ivan back: not directly anymore, but socially, almost politically, through persuasion, because that had always been her strength. She wanted to make everyone understand what was just, and to cause it to happen. It had only been in the fall that she had fully understood and accepted that the rupture was final, and for the best; that it had originated, not when Ivan met Eunice, but when Zita went to Thailand, to become the person she really was. Once she realized that, she felt less sad. Of course, an ending was always sad, but to not end something that needed to end was even more sad. Eunice, though not without her peculiarities, was right for Ivan. And Ivan was right for Eunice, in a way that he had not been right for Zita. This had been as difficult for Ivan to see as it had been for Zita. And this was what Zita wanted to tell me about Ivan: that he got into complicated situations sometimes, but it was because he had a big heart. Thinking over the dates, I realized that the time when Zita had reached these conclusions was the time I had first met Ivan. So all the time you knew him, he was living with Eunice already, Zita said, excitedly. I remembered the tidiness of Ivans dorm room, how he had talked about loaning it to a friend. I had never wondered why Ivan didnt have more stuff lying around, or where he stayed when he let other people use his room. Zita asked how much Ivan had told me about what had happened. But why should he have told me, when I had never asked? I had found out about Eunices existence, I told Zita, because we ran into her on the street. Oh my God. What did you say? Nothing. I mean, I said Nice to meet you, I said. What did she say? Nothing. She didnt say it was nice to meet me. She told Ivan he had to be home by nine. She must have been jealous, Zita said. Of course, I hope she feels more secure now. Ive moved on. I have a new boyfriend. Im happy now. Thats great, I said, recognizing the rule that, once you had a new boyfriend, you were happy. Zita said that, since she had told me her whole story, now I had to tell her mine. I felt a wave of anxiety. Her story had had a beginning, a middle, and an end. Nothing between Ivan and me had happened that way. It hadnt made sense, the way her story had. Thinking it over, the thing that had made the least sense was how someone had tried to talk to me from the Stanford email account, two weeks earlier. That wasnt you, was it? I asked Zita. No, of course not. So it really was Ivan? No, thats impossible. Then who was it? It cant have been anyone. But it happened. No, it couldnt have. I felt lost then, because however cooperative we tried to be, and actually managed to be, we both trusted Ivan more than we trusted each other. So, Zita said. I felt that she wanted somethingas was naturalin exchange for the story she had told me. Did I change your mind? Sunlight slanted in the window, enabling one to individually appreciate all the dust particles on Rileys CD tower. What was a person supposed to do? Serdar, for instance, had punched a wall. But that had only caused other people more trouble and expense. I decided to mail my mother a present. We were always looking out for presents to mail each other, and Id had my eye on a decorative candle shaped like the bust of Hippocrates. On the other hand, what good was a novelty candle? What good was the actual Hippocrates? Voices came from the hall. People were on their way to go eat or drink different things, before time passed and they had to eat or drink again. Surely there was more to life than just trying to avoid bad luck? I thought longingly about jumping out a windownot our bedroom window, which was blocked by the bed and was only on the third floor and overlooked the turtle-shaped kiddie pool of a childcare centerbut some other, higher window. For some reason, the image that came to my mind was of Peter explaining to someone in a quiet, serious voice that Selins problems had been more serious than anyone had realized. No way, I thought. I was going to stick around and bury those people. November The crying started with songs, and movies. Then it was in bed. I kept a roll of toilet paper jammed between the top bunk and the wall, and stuffed the used wads of toilet paper back into the cardboard cylinder. When I had to blow my nose, I hid under the duvet, so Riley wouldnt hear. Once I got really congested like that, though, I apparently started snoring, because as soon as the misery let up even a little bit, I was jerked right back into it by the sensation of Riley jabbing my mattress from below. A person had to be in a state of unremitting misery, at risk of preventing others from sleeping. When I woke up in the morning, there was a second or two when I felt light and free, unaware of any reason to feel upset. Then all my knowledge and memories rushed back and a weight descended on my sternum and the creaking started behind my eyes. I increased my hours at the Ukrainian Research Institute. What a relief that there was a way of converting time into something so clear and quantifiable. Sit there for an hour, and that was seven dollars. It turned out that a lot of things that people thought of as Russian were actually Ukrainian. Borscht, for example, and Gogol, whom Ukrainians called Hohol. This made him sound merry, though he was rarely invoked in a merry way. It was regretted that he hadnt written in his mother tongue. Gogols mother had had Gogol when she was sixteen. It turned out that Ukrainians, just like Turkish people, and Russians, and many people in Hungary, considered their culture to be uniquely torn between East and West. How many cultures didnt think that? I had once heard a Japanese person say it about Japan. The microwave in the Ukrainian Institute was definitely haunted. Katya tried to microwave a cup of tea, and opened the door to find the teabag sitting several inches away from the cup of water. The older Ukrainian women thought I was insensitive and annoying. Olha in particular hadnt thought life would have reduced her to this. Once, when I was making tea, I made an extra cup for Olha, the way I had seen her make it, with milk and three bags of sugar. In my science Core class, I had seen a video of someone adding milk to tea, played in reverse, so the milk unswirled itself from the tea and streamed back up into the pitcher. Apparently, the laws of physics didnt differentiate between the past and the future, so a video played backward couldnt show you anything impossible. It wasnt impossible, but just very unlikely, for stirred milk to separate like that. When I brought Olha the tea, I thought I saw some relaxation of the lines around her mouth and on her forehead. If a video of her face was played backward, the lines would disappear. Was that impossible in real life, or just extremely unlikely? I typed a manuscript about how the Kievan Rus was pre-Ukrainian and not pre-Russian. I transcribed a series of addresses by a Ukrainian ambassador. He never actually said anythingjust invoked bilateral relations and geopolitical alignments, and made an occasional arch remark about the clash of civilizations. Was that what it was to be a diplomat? How did anyone survive it? Depositing a paycheck, I noticed, immediately produced some dissociation from whatever work you did: a job was a job. (Was that how the Holocaust had happened?) One evening after I deposited my check, I stopped at the newspaper store in the square and bought a pack of cigarettes: Parliaments, the first brand that came to mind. I didnt want to stand there too long reading the different brands, in case the storekeeper got suspicious and asked for ID. I had IDyou only had to be eighteenbut any kind of dispute or challenge, however quickly resolved, would have ruined the smoothness of the transaction, which was somehow part of itas was the box with the blue-and-navy panel, and the seal that resembled the Pan Am pilot badge, from back when people got specially dressed up to take airplanes, and armrests had built-in ashtrays. I thought of the parliament building in Budapest: how suddenly it sprang into view across the river, how regally cakelike, just when you thought you were lost, and how strange to think that it still existed, now, in November, at what must have beenI checked my watchtwo in the morning. Quite possibly there were people working there this minute, speaking Hungarian, steering the ship of state, emptying the wastebaskets. Matches? the storekeeper asked, showing no interest in my age. I felt wonder at the matchbook: an actual little book, with a staple. For free. The thing Prometheus had paid for with his liver. In the foyer of the library, it occurred to me to look for Zitas thesis. It wasnt on the shelves. So, she hadnt won a prize. Was that because she cared more about people and emotions than about abstract concepts? I did find Zitas thesis in the online library catalog. The entry included the name of the temple where she had studied in Thailand. Following the same zombielike compulsion that had made me look up her thesis in the first place, I located an entry on the temple in an encyclopedia of Eastern religions. Apparently, the monks there were in conflict with most other Thai Buddhists, because of their belief that, when you reached nirvana, the thing you reached was the true self. The others thought that nirvana meant reaching the not-self. The words controversy and dispute were used several times. I felt surprised to learn that Buddhist monks were so argumentative. On some level, it felt exciting to have a personal connection, however tenuous, to this material that was so far from my own experience. It seemed to be something I had achieved through writing. Listening to my Walkman and smoking a cigarette by the river, I felt a kind of elevation in my chest, my eyes opened wider, I felt more alive. There was something about crying so much, the way it made my body so limp and hot and shuddering, that made me feel closer to sex. Maybe there was a line where sex and total sadness touchedone of those surprising borders that turned out to exist, like the one between Italy and Slovenia. Music, too, was adjacent. It was like Trieste, which was Italian and Slovenian and also somehow Austrian. Music was the thing that made it the most clear what sex would be like. The feeling of different places being touched and resonating at the same time. Like sitting on a parapet with your eyes closed, feeling sunlight on your left eyelid and a breeze on your right forearm. Music was the only other thing that was layered like that, so that each new component changed the meaning of the whole. And so much building up and holding backpromising and withholding, and withholding, and withholding. Youre going to die without it. Youre never going to get it. Youre going to die. Here it is. At first, I didnt see the point of an orgasm. It seemed like an annoying abrupt spasm that interrupted things just when they were getting interesting. But gradually it started to take longer to get to, and to unfold into its own experience, and then it became this sought-after thing in the distancelike during the long periods in a symphony when nothing seemed to be happening, when it was just shifting textures, and then a glimmer of the soaring sought-after melody shone throughand the fact that you could glimpse it, even for a second, was a miracle that promised everything, that deferred everything to the future, and made living seem worthwhile. I knew that what I had experienced was clitoral orgasm, which was immature and incomplete and somehow selfish and immoral, by comparison with a vaginal orgasm. The flickering, pulsing, agitated feeling I had sometimes afterward was proof. It wasnt real or right by yourself. But what was the man going to dohow was it going to work? I tried again to put in a tampon. ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WAY. In music, the thing that made it work often wasnt the obvious delighting melody, but something somewhere further downmaybe not in any one of the components, but in the combination, the notes that proliferated and branched out and merged back together; the way they tensed against each other, and promised to resolve, and then went somewhere so unexpected and yet absolutely, in retrospect, necessary, that you had to replay it over and over, because remembering it wasnt the same. The devastating line at the end of The Seducers Diary: If I were a god I would do for her what Neptune did for a nymph: change her into a man. Would Ivan do that for me? YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FOR ME. The thought made me come, sobbing. The bathroom was the only place you could lock the door. I had the shower on, but was lying on a towel on the floor, so I could concentrate better. Riley rapped sharply on the doorshe had to use the bathroom. I had a recurring dream that I was in high schoolstranded for at least the day, and probably every day for years. A question had come up about the validity of my diploma, and my mother had reenrolled me and paid the tuition. It wasnt that she really cared about the diploma; she was just excited about how I would finally get a really good education, I would really understand physics. At some point in the dream, I was trying to explain to the principal that I didnt actually have to be there. I had come as a courtesy to my mother. I no longer needed the diploma. I didnt mention Harvard, because I knew it would enrage the principal, causing him to think that I was saying that I was too good to be there. The principal pointed out acidly that I was hardly doing anyone else a favor with my presence; there was a very real chance that I hadnt actually graduated, that I hadnt earned the credits I thought, and if he were me he would be very worried. For some reason, the most painful part was knowing that the whole situation was my own doing. There was no longer any law that said I had to be at school. But the bus had shown up at seven in the morning and honked and honked, ever more insistently and expressively of the mounting anger of everyone who was being kept waitingand I had gotten on. At the same time, I knew that, although nonattendance in high school was technically possible, and even expected, for most people in my position, it was somehow impossible for me, personallybecause of who I was. When I related this dream at brunch, it turned out that everyone except Priya had a high school nightmare. The one with the most similar dream to mine was Lucas. He, too, was our current agethe age where we were supposed to be in collegeand a stressful part of the dream was the struggle to find somewhere in his old school where he could secretly try to keep up with his assignments for college. It was also his mother who had reenrolled him, saying that he would finally really learn math. In tutorial, we did a unit on Freud. We read Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria. Her father brought Dora to see Freud, because she was coughing and choking, and because she had slapped the fathers friend. Freud had to take her history. The ability to take a history was something my mother often talked about: who had it, who didnt. It wasnt as simple as just asking the person. Patients often cannot give an ordered history of their lives, Freud wrote. The word patient made my stomach clench. I didnt want to become a doctor, but sometimes I worried it was the only way to avoid being a patient. Freud said that the problem with Dora was that she was secretly in love with her fathers friend, Herr Kthe one she had slapped. She only thought that she hated him, because she was afraid of sex, and had repressed her own sexual desires. Dora recounted to Freud how Herr K had ambushed her from behind a door and kissed her. Freud said that a normal virginal girl of fourteen would have felt a healthy genital sensation to learn that such an honorable and attractive man was in love with her. Instead, Dora had an unhealthy, choking response in her throat. This proved that Dora was also in love with her father, who was having an affair with Ks wife. The choking was because she was jealous that Ks wife got to have oral sex with Doras father. (So oral sex involved your throat?) Dora filled me with despair. What if someone told me that it was my sexual motives and frustration behind all my problemsmy jealous and sexual love of my parents? I also felt demoralized by how far ahead of me Dora was, because she had attracted a man, and had been kissed by him when she was fourteenwhereas I had passed sweet sixteen, and seventeen, and eighteen. In class, we learned that there were two ways to interpret Dora: (1) Freud was right and Dora was in love with both her father and K; (2) Freud was an unreliable narrator who over-identified with K. Reading Dora was supposed to teach us to read a text interpretively, the way Freud read Dora herself. Interpretively seemed to mean with belligerence and hostility. Judith wanted us to see the text as a performance in which Freud, the author, had to establish authority, by marginalizing interpretations different from his own. We had to learn how discourses were taking power, how to identify a texts blindnesses and learn to take power and authority for ourselves. There was something depressing in this picture of everyone scrambling to grab power and authority over each other, before their own authority and power were grabbed. Why did people still read Freud: because he had been right, or because he hadnt been right? What exactly had been wrong with Dora? The word hysteria was always spoken with irony, as if it was too backward and un-feminist to merit discussion. We learned that hystera was Greek for uterus, and that Hippocrates believed that womens uteruses could become unmoored and wander around their bodies. This was clearly not correct. Judith used an overhead projector to show us photographs from the clinic in Paris where hysteria was first documented. The doctor, Charcot, had asserted power over the women by documenting them. One woman was lying in bed with her arms outstretched, as if she had been crucified. Another was yawning angrily. Some women were having convulsions where they arched their backs. Some of them actually had epilepsy, strokes, or brain damage. Epilepsy, strokes, and brain damage were real. People still got them. But nobody got hysteria anymore. Apparently, the thing that had been giving people hysteria was repressive Victorian norms. We didnt have those norms anymore, so we didnt have hysteria, either. Riley made me a tape of her Fiona Apple album. I initially mistrusted Fiona Apple, because of her belligerent, model-like beauty, because she was my age but sang in a scornful way about her ex-boyfriends, and because the lyrics sounded like she had been forced to use vocabulary words. But after I had listened to the album all the way through a few times, the janky grammar and word choices began to seem legitimate and necessary, and I understood that it was possible to look like thatglaring and tousled, with your limbs all in some artful pileand also be good at something. Fiona Apples album made me more immediately depressed than any other music I remembered hearing. The most depressing songs were the ones with meandering arbitrary piano, that went from meandering to decisive and then back again. How did she know when to do that? The one that started Days like this, I dont know what to do with myself made me feel certain that I had spent my whole life not knowing what to do with myselfall day, and all night. I wander the halls... That was exactly it: not the streets, like a flneur, but the halls. Oh, I knew just which halls. The recordings I knew best were all classical, because of violin, and because my father only listened to classical music, so that was what we had at home. My mother had listened to American pop music, but only on the radio. I had thought of it as radio music. For many years, I hadnt realized that it even came on records or tapes. The essential qualities of radio music were: a tone of oracular truth; an appeal to you; an uncertainty as to whether you yourself were you. Radio music was summed up by the woman with the sexless, sphinxlike voice who had traveled the world and the seven seas, and had found that everybody was looking for something. Some of them want to use you; some of them want to be used by you: I recognized this to be absolutely true, without qualificationeither despite, or because of, how it contradicted the logic of self-interest, in a way that would be revealed by adult life, and would be in some way its defining feature. Tower Records was the least cool place to buy music, but the one where you were the most free from any expectation of knowing anything or talking to anyone. The cover art for the new Fugees album looked like the poster for The Godfather. What was more alienating: the album art that wasnt targeting me, or the album art that clearly was (Fiona Apple)? The Fugees album had the cover of Killing Me Softly: a song I had first heard in the spring, at a club in Boston. I had only gone to keep Lakshmi company, because Noor was DJ-ing. On the way to the T station, we had passed a few feet behind Ivan and Eunice. They were standing in a crowd, watching a guy play the guitar, and the sight of them had vaporized any thought Id had of turning back. It became imperative to go forward, into whatever else there was. Lakshmi had assured me, when I pointed it out, that the insufferability of clubs was widely acknowledged. Why else did I think everyone was on drugs the whole time? My reluctance to talk to the guy you had to talk to to get the drugs was exceeded only by my mistrust of the drugs themselves. If I messed up my brain, what else did I have? Why wasnt Lakshmi scared? Noor hadnt been the one to play Killing Me Softly (or any other music that had words, or was recognizable in any other way). It had been the next DJ, the one who seemed like DJ-ing was his job. I immediately recognized it as an old songthe kind you heard as a kid, and knew that the world it came from and referred to was not only closed to you, but was one that in some sense you yourself had brought to an end, so that whatever it was really about was something that no longer existed, and that you could never haveexcept that now you were having it, because it had been transformed, uprooted, dragged into now, and some seemingly foreclosed possibility had opened up again. Up to that moment, I had thought that the reason it was embarrassing to be in a club was because of not feeling anything, and having to go through the motions. But it turned out that feeling thingsfeeling so muchwas even more embarrassing. Once you stripped away the music, the way I was always doing in my mind, to weigh the words and assess their meaning, strumming my pain with his fingers was unbearably embarrassing, like something you wrote in middle school. But when Lauryn Hill sang it, against a harmony that changed with each phrase, and changed, and changed, and changed again, so you didnt know where it was, or where you wereand the not-knowing was related to his fingers, which were in turn so immediately connected to your painit was a feeling I couldnt believe I was having in public. Then, the song became about that, and embarrassed by the crowd rhymed with how he found her letters and read each one aloud. Her letters? Who even wrote letters anymore? Who, besides me and Tatiana? The idea of him reading my letters out loud. Of being fixed to the spot, praying that he would stop. The idea of being totally seen, but not pitied or stopped-at, of him relentlessly telling my whole life with his words. My life, with his words. It had never occurred to me to buy a recording of Killing Me Softly. Was that because the Fugees was hip-hop? Killing Me Softly had some of the features of hip-hop that I usually found alienating, like a man saying Uh, uh, in the background. But the man, despite several false alarms, never did start rapping, and instead a girl sang an old song with beautiful harmonies. In relation to Killing Me Softly, I was surely a poseur, the kind of coward to whom crossover albums were marketed or, worse yet, someone co-opting someone elses bad experience. And yet, now, in the Tower Records, I understood that there was a sense in which Killing Me Softly was just a songit itself wasnt the cursive font in which the titles were printed, which made me think of a tattoo, and caused me to feel sheltered and useless. I ended up buying the cassette single, because it was only two dollars, and because it seemed more honest about just being into the most popular song on the album. Once I could listen to Killing Me Softly whenever I wanted, I was able to put together the whole story. Lauryn Hill heard about this guy who was a good singer, who had a style. It was exciting to think that people at a certain level of competence knew about, and periodically checked up on, one another, and that her admiration of his competence was predicated on her own competencewhich was, within the song, the only thing you heard. You didnt hear his skills, but her evocation of them; her turning them on you. (So, it was possible to make someone else feel that way: the way someone had made you feel.) Insofar as those guys, Wyclef Jean and the others, were even there at all, it was just to set everything up for Lauryn Hillfor her to destroy everyone, with a display of technique that was unquestionable and brutal, like the end of chapter three in Eugene Onegin. They had queued up her entranceL, you know you got the lyricsthe way Pushkin queued up Tatianas letter, with the same pride and confidence. I recognized, in their solicitude, something that I had felt in emails with Ivan: the way he had made me feel my own competence, even saying once about the way that I wrote that I had a style. I felt that he was right, I did have a style, in that sense, even if in the other senseof living in an apartment in the right city, surrounded by the right things, wearing an interestingly heavy wristwatch that foregrounded my frail wristI did not. Somehow this thought made me feel worse, not better. Tears sprang to my eyes, and my heart filled with yearning. For tutorial, we read part of The Interpretation of Dreams. It turned out that dreams were easy to interpret. They were all repressed desires. Did I secretly want to be back in high school? Freud said that dj vu in dreams was always about the genitals of the dreamers mother; there is indeed no other place about which one can assert with such conviction that one has been there once before. I felt relieved to think that this was not the case for me. My mom had gotten really sick when I was bornshe had almost diedand I had been delivered a month early, by a C-section. Apparently, a lot of children dreamed about murdering their siblings. Freud sounded like he was making fun of them: of the small boy whose autocratic rule was upset, after lasting for fifteen months, by the birth of a sister; of the girl who dreamed that all her siblings and cousins grew wings and flew away, leaving our little baby-killer alone, as she wanted, with her parents. I felt thankful that I had never had a dream like that, and was reminded of all the adults who had observed of me, during my childhood, that I was an only child, that I must be spoiled rotten, that I must love having my parents attention all to myself. Leora had always said, whenever she wondered why she was one way and I was another: My mother says its because youre an only child. Youre an only child. Later, in high school, the glee with which Clarissa asked, Do you miss being an only child? Whenever we played Truth or Dare. How do you really feel about your stepmother and your half-brother? I kept starting emails to Ivan. Dear Ivan, Did you try to talk to me? Dear Ivan, I had a strange conversation with Dear Ivan, My general contempt for psychiatry is reason enough for my not yet having dared investigate what has become of Sonya. Thou, Nature, What do you want to dance about, you black hole? I have a cat now. Nothing happens that I dont want to tell you. The cat is in the box. The cats poop, on the other hand... Are you dead, or arent you? It is possible, in rare cases, to go to hell in your lifetime. Persephones abduction to the underworld represents her function as the personification of vegetables. In spring they shoot forth What? No. Moscow does not believe in tears. Sevastopol does not believe in earwax. Minsk does not believe in black bile. It was like we didnt have the language between us to talk about anything normal. Dear Ivan, Olha at the Ukrainian Research Institute does not care for me. She did not think that her fate would have been so terrible. But she cant unstir the milk in her tea, so it looks like time is still just going one way. Now Hohol is in his sleigh, silver bells a-ringing, his sack full of dead souls for all the good children. When will we talk about genre theory? Please forgive me. Selin Rob came in and, in my hurry to look like I was working, I accidentally hit Ctrl-S instead of Ctrl-D. I sent that? For literature tutorial, we read part of Swanns Way, which was the first book of Remembrance of Things Past. Calling it that, instead of translating the title literally as In Search of Lost Time, was supposed to be a way of conveying Prousts universal status to an English-speaking audience, because remembrance of things past was a line from Shakespeare. I thought In Search of Lost Time sounded exciting and detective-like, and Remembrance of Things Past sounded lame. When to the sessions of sweet silent thought / I summon up remembrance of things past: I didnt like when people used sweet about non-sensory experiences. Why were we in my mouth all of a sudden? Nor did I believe poets when they went on about what a fun activity it was for them to call up old memories. It was like when old people said that all they had needed for entertainment was a stick and a piece of string, and it was their way of criticizing you for watching TV. Something about the name Proust sounded fussy, and made me worry that he wouldnt have liked me. All I really knew about him was that he wrote wonderfully about childhood and about the French countryside. Why did the idea of the French countryside make me feel despairing? It looked OK in Van Gogh paintings. And that was where he had cut off his earso it had been intense. Ivan had asked me that once about New Jerseywhether it had been intensemaking me realize that intensity was, indeed, what one valued in place. Childhood was somehow the opposite of intense. Maybe that was my issue, and not the French countryside. I realized that I never had liked books about childhoodexcept, when I was a child, the kinds of books where the children themselves solved mysteries or had adventures. But books about childhood that were written for adults? I misheard some word and thought it meant something else. I mistakenly thought there was a relationship between two unrelated words or concepts. I didnt understand this thing that I later found out was about sex. I ate something delicious. My mother looked like an angel. I was unfairly punished. Out of my three friends who had read Swanns Way, Leora said it was so boring that she could hear her own hair grow. Svetlana looked embarrassed and said it took some effort to get into, but eventually the rhythm was hypnotic. It turned out she had read all seven volumes. Proust is difficult, but not as difficult as Joyce, Lakshmi said. Mostly what she wanted to talk about was this freshman, Mia, who was friends with Noor, and who said that her favorite book was Finnegans Wake. Lakshmi asked if I thought a freshman could have read and understood Finnegans Wake. Who wants to understand Finnegans Wake, though? I said. Yes, of course youre right, Lakshmi said immediately. Then she didnt say anything for a while. I suppose its possible that she did understand it, and shes really brilliant. Svetlana had started doing meditation. I didnt want to think about my breath for twenty minutes. I sometimes went with Svetlana to Pilateseven though the logistics of mat placement was deeply stressful, in a way that made me feel like I understood the primal conflicts for land that formed the basis of modern history. The room had a maximum occupancy of thirty, which might have been OK if everyone was just sitting there, but not if the idea was to make your body as long as possible and do sweeping motions with your limbs. Svetlana always made us get there early, to secure an advantageous position. Then the people who came later would try to crowd us out, inserting themselves between us, or directly in front of us, blocking our viewnot apologetically, but with a self-righteous attitude. If you didnt defend your space like Svetlana did, sitting up extra straight and doing elaborate stretches, you got hemmed in and couldnt do the movements. People kept hitting you (or were you hitting them?) and giving you dirty looks. One time, I was late to Pilates. Then I saw how everyone who had gotten there earlier was avoiding eye contact and doing stretches in the clear hope that I wouldnt sit near them, and would sit somewhere else. This felt unfair and hurtful: I had signed up on time, and had as much right to be there as they did. I had run all the way, and would have been early, except that I had been on the phone with my aunt, who wanted me to sign a piece of paper saying that I would be the adult guardian for my autistic cousin, David, after she and my uncle died. How confident the other people in the class seemed to be in the rights that had been conferred on them by being there firstwhich was really only a matter of luck, because their aunts hadnt happened to call just then. Where, exactly, did they want me to go? Did they want me to just not exist? Was that how the Israelis and Palestinians felt about each other? I found myself looking to the instructor to arbitrate, but the instructor never did care about the fair allocation of space. She just said, Theres plenty of room for everyone. This was because of how flattered she felt by the number of people who came to the class, which she took as a personal compliment, rather than an indication of how stressed-out we were about our bodies. Every time a new person walked in the door, causing dread in everyone who was already there, the instructor seemed happier and more pleased with herself. Her attitude reminded me of the tone in which my mother had sometimes relayed to me, when I was in high school, that someone or other at work had told her that she could still have a child, or have another child. She said it in a scoffing way at first, then added in a small voice that she supposed it was possible. I knew that she wasnt actually going to do it, and I shouldnt begrudge her the pleasure that the thought clearly gave her. But I couldnt help feeling panic. As matters stood, we never slept enough, and occasionally ran out of money. Why was it delightful to her to think about making things harder? Dear Selin, Olha has a difficult problem. It is no wonder that she is grouchy. You should try to be patient. Of course I forgive you. I dont know anything about genre theory, but I can learn. Ivan I hadnt expected Ivan to write back. It felt magical, like hearing from a dead person. I almost started to cry. Then I did finger and saw that Ivan was actually logged on to the Harvard network. He was physically here. Such relieflike some vital element had been restored to the atmosphere. He was finally here again, like last year, and he must have been planning to see me; that was why there had been hope and futurity in his tone. I wondered if I should write back to him, but I decided to wait for him to call, as I was sure that he would. With the passage of time, this expectation came to strike me as insane. Of course he wasnt going to call. If he had hoped to see me, he would have told me he was coming. He was here to visit his girlfriend, to have sex with his girlfriend, to do any number of things and to see any number of people, but not me. I was literally the one person he would be least likely to want to see, out of everyone on the planet, including all the people he had never met. All I wanted was to be unconsciousto be asleepto experience that moment of freedom in the morning, right when you woke up. I always felt it was my fault for not managing to prolong it. But even in the moment when I was steeling myself to prolong it, I had already forgotten what it was that I was trying to ward off, and the effort of remembering would bring it all back. I checked my watch. It was only four in the afternoon. How was I going to survive until bedtime? I wondered, not for the first time, whether it was possible to knock yourself unconscious by banging your head into a wall. But I knew that, if banging your head into a wall was a solution to the problem of consciousness, I would have heard about it by now. I decided to just go to the river and run until I got tired. (Was that what running was?) When a song was about love, I felt the heavy gears start behind my eyes and in my sinuses. The songs that werent about love seemed deliberately crypticalmost frightening. Though I had hoped to run for two hours, I got a cramp after twenty minutes. I tried and failed to power through. So: I wasnt even allowed to exhaust my body. I turned around and started to walk, blinking back tears as stronger, more admirable people ran or biked past me. Did they have the strength to run through their cramps, or were they so strong that they didnt get cramps? When I got back to where I had started, I kept walking in the opposite direction. Walking didnt really change anything, the way running did, but time did continue to pass in the irreversible-seeming way that was attributable to the second law of thermodynamics. Soon, the sun had started to take itself elsewhere. At least one was vouchsafed that dignity: the passage from day to night, the illumination of the headlights that made human affairs resemble, to some slight extent, the cosmological formations that didnt have feelings or experience disgrace. When I got home, Riley and Priya were getting ready to go to a party. Their premed friend Lewis was involved. The thought of the Lewis-clones in their drab pullovers, being witty and explanatory, expelling their robotic little laughs, was too dire to contemplate. Nor had I been invited. We exchanged jokes while they got dressed. By the time they left, it was almost nine. In only an hour, it would be a legitimate time to go to sleep. I could read in bed. I brushed my teeth and climbed into the top bunk and picked up Swanns Way. For a long time I went to bed early. My eyes filled, I couldnt see, I couldnt breathe. For a long time? It was actually disturbing, how much of Swanns Way was about trying to fall asleep. Some of it was interestinglike when he fell asleep reading and thought his body was the rivalry between Franois I and Charles V, because thats what he had been reading about. Or when he realized that his body could remember the furniture and configuration of all the other bedrooms he had slept in over his whole life. I felt somehow relieved to discover that I remembered the configuration of two bedrooms I had slept in in Ivans parents housewhere the door and the window and the table were. But I didnt like when Proust laid his cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow, as plump and fresh as the cheeks of childhood. I wasnt into cheeks. Some people loved them. Those cheeks! women said, before they squeezed childrens cheeks. My mother had used to speak gloatingly and enviously about my cheeks, always clarifying that hers werent the same, she didnt have baby fat. I had never liked it when she emphasized our differences. I had always wanted to look more like her. Maybe the problem was childhood again. Falling asleep was interesting if you had the resources to confuse your own leg for a conflict between European kings, or to mentally review a space-time map of different bedroom furniture. But I didnt want to read about trying to fall asleep as a child. The part where his relatives got him a magic lantern: They had indeed hit upon the idea, to distract me on the evenings when they found me looking too unhappy, of giving me a magic lantern.... Their kindnesswhen they were the ones who had caused his problem. The magic lantern reminded me of the shadow puppets on Turkish TV, and of the brass carousel on the piano in my Ankara grandmothers apartment. When you lit the candles, paper-thin brass angels turned slowly in a circle. How hard it was to describe, and how unrewarding. Yet there was a compulsion to describe it: the same compulsion clearly felt by many people to write vivid descriptions of things in their grandparents houses. If I had to read about one more persons grandmothers sofa, about how it smelled like cough drops... Prousts description of his grandmother herself was upsettingly sentimentalthe way he went on about how much she loved them all, and disregarded herself. Her love and lack of self-regard were expressed in a smile which, unlike those seen on the majority of human faces, bore no trace of irony save for herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes. A grandmothers love, her kisses: what did they mean? What was it to love a bunch of random people whom you maybe didnt understand at allit seemed pretty clear that baby Proust was misunderstood by his grandparentsjust because they were related to you? What was good about that: about a grandmothers love for you and disregard of herself? My Adana grandmother would stare into space, her eyes filled with tears. Once, I had suggested that she keep a diary: something I did, to keep from being bored and crying. Ah, maallah, my girl is always writing, ah ah, you write your diary. Me, what do I have to rememberand her eyes swam tearfully. How I loved our church, and how clearly I can see it still! Proust wrote, about a place where he had clearly been bored out of his mind. He described the graceful Gothic arcades which crowded coquettishly around a staircaselike a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a rustic, peevish and ill-dressed younger brother. The personification of the arcades reminded me of naps during which, to keep from dying of boredom, I used to hold my hand with the palm facing me and examine the fingernails which, seen upside-down or (in the case of the thumbnail) sideways, seemed to have different physiognomies and expressions. The index finger was a suppliant woman, with a big trembling smile; the middle finger, bigger and good-natured, a man, with a wider and less suppliant smile. On the ring finger, the white part of the nail had a different shape, giving it the brisk and ironical expression of my aunt Arzu (my mothers cousin), while the pinkie looked like a diminutive waiter: lithe and deferential. The thumb was genial and grinning, with a big jaw. In profile, the index fingers had an adoring expression. They could look up adoringly at each other, or look down shyly. The hours I had spent like that, making my fingers simper at each other. I would never write about that. It was enough I had wasted the time once. I would never waste more time by writing about it. In tutorial, the part of Swanns Way that Judith talked the most about was the good-night kiss, or the bedtime kiss. The phrases were repulsive to me, as was the way Proust seemed to conflate his childhood love for his mother with romantic love between non-children. It was like when people joked knowingly about men who had mommy issuesit made falling in love seem babyish and unromantic. It was like my uncles who, whenever I had held one of my aunts babies and the baby clutched at my chestthis was in middle school, before I had breastswould laugh hysterically and say, Youre looking for something that isnt there. The episode itself, about baby Prousts anguish on nights when his parents had dinner guests, was harrowing. I didnt like to admit it, but I was pretty sure that I had felt the same despair when my parents went to dinner parties. Being left at night for a party was so much worse than being left in the daytime for work; what was, for you, a cause of desperation, was for them an occasion for dress-up and celebration. But why did Proust have to keep thinking about it? Why couldnt he write a book about something else? When I went home for Thanksgiving, my mother was funny and cool. Her new breasts stayed up by themselves, so she could throw out all her bras. She made an amazing meal as usual, from The Silver Palate Cookbook, and explained the new drug she was taking, how ingeniously it worked, by blocking estrogen from the hormone receptors on cancer cells. A side effect of the drugs was that you got hot flashes and stopped having your period. You had to take the drug for five years, so, depending on how old you were when you started, your period might not come back. Of all the side effects of menopause, my mother seemed the most concerned about her voice deepening. I thought about whether I would want to get implants, if I ever had to have my breasts removed. When my fathers sister had stayed with us after her mastectomy, she had cried at dinner every night. One night, she said that she didnt feel like a woman anymore because she didnt have breasts. I didnt have breasts, and I didnt think it was a big deal. But I understood that it was a big deal, because my father, who usually tried to minimize my aunts worries, fell silent and didnt tell her to stop crying. On the other hand, I still remembered how stressed-out Leora and I had been to start getting breasts, a year or two later. Was it possible to go back to that mental state? In my former bedroom, I stared at all my old books. I took down my high school copy of Eugene Onegin. That was when I discovered or remembered something important, namely, that the guy I had first identified with Onegin had been, not Ivan, whom I hadnt met yet, but, rather, my violin teacher. How could I have forgotten that so completely? How could one person just replace another like that? How much of everything had started with my violin teacher, who was Russian, and married, and had two children? He was the one to whom I had imagined writing a letterthe one I had imagined showing up, like a grim shade. He really had resembled a grim shade, it was almost like that was the look he was going for. I thought this was funnyjust like Eugene Onegin was funny. It was how funny Pushkin was about Onegin that made the whole thing seem benevolent and sparkling. It wasnt like I hadnt seen my violin teachers limitations. Clearly, there was something sketchy and undignified about him, something that didnt reflect well about how physically present and brooding he acted, how he called on the phone late at night to reschedule lessons, how he looked at me and touched my arm and took my violin and held it or played it or tuned it, forcing the pegs when they stuck. Also, even though private lessons were supposed to be covered by the music school tuition, he kept trying to get my mother to pay him extra, because he said he was so much better than all the other teachers. This stressed out my mom, and was unattractive, and made the whole thing now feel somehow shameful. But he was so good at the violin, and the way he was good was so complicated and had so many things to notice. And he was working so hard, for that hour we spent together, every week, to make me betterlistening so attentively, taking whatever I had played, and returning it, transformed and beautiful. At a time when all I thought about was escape or rescuehe had rescued me. He had rescued me from poor bow-direction-changing. I had been alone with the traumatic scratchiness of the change from up-bow to down-bowand he had shown me how to control the pressure and speed, until you couldnt hear the change, and the sound just kept pouring like velvet. Was it possible that, although I thought of Ivan as my first love, it had all happened already with my violin teacher? I hadnt written him a letter. But I had had the feelings that Tatiana had when she wrote to Onegin, that repeated when I wrote to Ivan: the feeling of having put myself in his power, entrusted myself to his honor, like I was falling, like I could die, but he would catch me... probably. I had felt it every week, in the drafty studio with the green wallpaper and the window overlooking Riverside Park. And yet, the second time had blocked out the first time, and I didnt like to think that it hadnt been the first time. That whole time, all of high school and also middle school, was something I didnt like to think about. It had been like prison. I knew it was wrong to compare my experience at a prep school in New Jersey to that of a disadvantaged person in an actual prison. Still, I compared it. Enforced idleness, arbitrary punishment, being trapped for hours among people crazed by hormones and boredom.... Some rewards went to the domineering, others to the servile. You couldnt not be in an unhealthy relationship to power. The worst part was the school bus, because you couldnt get off, and the American boys did stuff like batting at the drivers head with their lacrosse sticks. The driver, Darnell, who was, in retrospect, gay, would utter theatrical protests, but didnt seem to view the situation as alterable in any way, and would just crank up the volume on his Queen tape. A sickening realization: driving on the highway, contrary to what adults were constantly saying, did not require total concentration, and Darnell was eminently capable of doing it while being hit on the head with a lacrosse stick. The next thought that came to me was the relieving one that, so long as they were occupied with Darnell, the lacrosse boys werent persecuting me. I immediately felt ashamed. Later I saw a similar thought expressed in a Holocaust memoir, and felt better, and then felt worse. The gap between Darnells front teeth, together with the unselfconscious way he sang along with Bohemian Rhapsody, reminded me of my youngest aunt, and made me feel close to him. The first ten times I heard Bohemian Rhapsody, I didnt understand how it was a song, and felt that the others were justified in scoffing at it. But there eventually came a time when Darnell screamed, Mama! I killed a man! and I was moved to tears, feeling certain that I, too, had killed a man. I wanted to do something for Darnell, but felt powerless against the lacrosse boys who, once I was brought to their attention in any way, would start snickering and droning to each other about how ugly I was. The one with disfiguring acne said that I was the ugliest girl in the school. His friend always took my part: I just dont know. The ugliest? They ended amicably, united in the consensus that it would be impossible for anyone to have sex with me. I wrote a letter to the bus company, asking them to name Darnell Driver of the Month. It was something he always talked about: who had gotten Driver of the Month and how he hoped it would someday be him. Instead of making him Driver of the Month, they gave him the letter. He kept it tucked behind the sun visor and referred to it frequently, and I was so embarrassed I wished I had never written it. That whole time, six years, I had always been in love with someone. It was the only thing that made it feasible to live that way, getting up at six and remaining conscious until late at night. It was like religion had been, for medieval people: it gave you the energy to face a life of injustice, powerlessness, and drudgery. The guys I was in love with always ignored me, but were never unkind. There was something abstract and gentle about the experience of being ignoreda feeling of being spared, a known impossibility of anything happeningthat was consonant with my understanding of love. In theory, of course, I knew that love could be reciprocated. It was a thing that happened, often, to other people. But I was unlike other people in so many ways. I knew that my mother, who was smarter than everyone else and also beautiful, had also never had a boyfriend in high school. Her sister said it was because she was too smart, she had seen through everyone, there hadnt been anyone worthy of her. That wasnt what my mother said. My mother said she had longed for a boyfriend and had listened to sad American songs and cried every night. Im so glad youre not like that. Im so glad you dont care. Youre so much smarter than I am. If I were you I would have been in love with one of those losers, she said. I often was in love with one of the losers, but I kept it to myself. My mothers love life changed when she was seventeen and went to the top medical school in Turkey and met my father. So I always assumed that things would change for me, too, when I left high school. In the meantime, I experienced those guys indifference as a benign, even beneficent forceone that supported me in the struggle to study and to get out. There was a problem in it somewhere, because the point of getting out was to become a writer and write novels, and novels were all about that other kind of lovethe kind where something happened. But when had I not had to dismiss some concern about the disjuncture between literature and the way I was living my life? In middle school I had been troubled by Huckleberry Finn and Holden Caulfield, who didnt care about grades, and who had the courage to run away. Would they have despised me? Over the weekend, my mother and I drove to New York to see a Picasso exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. We strolled through slowly, arm in arm, reading the wall text aloud, and sharing our opinions. My mother would observe fondly, yet somehow begrudgingly, that a painting was beautiful; or sometimes, disapprovingly: very ugly. Of a painting we only sort of liked, we would say, tolerantly, He did his bestliterally, he did what came from his hand: one of the many basic Turkish phrases that sounded, to me, like a world-weary witticism. The exhibit was all portraits. The portraits documented Picassos relationship with the women he was having sex with. Each woman was linked to a different style of painting, though the style sometimes preceded the woman who later embodied it. Fernande Olivier was Cubist. Olga Khokhlova was Neoclassical. Marie-Thrse Walter was surreal biomorphism, and Dora Maar was anguished Expressionism. The extent to which Picasso idealized or disfigured the women in his paintings was a test: not just of their physical beauty, but in some way of their human worth. Franoise Gilot dominated Picassos affection for nearly a decade. Gifted as a painter and writer, Gilot functioned as his co-equal. Picassos depictions of her and their two children, Paloma and Claude, are among his most unequivocally admiring images. How had Franoise succeeded? It wasnt just that she herself had been an artist. After all, Dora Maar had been a famous photographer, and she had failed. She had become the Weeping Woman. Green, jagged, screaming, Dora crammed into her mouth a handkerchief that resembled broken glass. Her body was crucified onto an armchair. Her face was woven into a basket. When Picasso left her for Franoise, who was twenty years younger than Dora (and forty years younger than Picasso), Dora was found naked in the stairwell of her apartment. She ended up in a sanatorium, getting electric shock therapy for three weeks. Lacan cured her, but she came out a Catholic, and didnt make any art for ten years. What should a persons attitude be toward Picasso? As a child, I had felt bullied by him. In photographs, bald, aggressive, bull-like yet boyish, he had reminded me of Jerry. It was the boyishness that was sinister. I felt he was trying to take something that rightly belonged to childrenone of the few things we hadand keep it for himself. The bullied feeling was connected to the way you had to choose between either the art teacher, who said that Picasso was a genius, or the kind of people who only liked photorealistic paintings of cars. I would side, under such circumstances, with Picasso, but I wasnt happy about it. In high school, Picasso had seemed somewhat less threatening. Even though nothing in my external life had changedeven though my mother was still an elegant heroic woman, and I was an awkward overprivileged teenager with no power or independence or boyfriendnonetheless there was a dimension, separate from perceptible reality, in which the balance had shifted. Love affairs no longer felt only like a power my parents had to menace me from a distance. They were a venue through which, if only hypothetically, I could be the one who was specialwho could finally have someone on my side, apart from myself. By then I was thinking more practically about how to become a writer, and I understood that a person had to appreciate Picassonot all of him, but the part that was an artist. It was an intellectual exercise that made you feel proud of your open-mindedness and objectivity. You could note how he was an asshole, and hold it in part of your mind, and then, with the rest of your mind, appreciate how totally he had managed to express himself. If you were in favor of individualism, self-expression, and human achievement; if you believed it was admirable to stay alive and awake, to not be deadened and blinded by conventions; if you were generous, subtle, capable of complexity and nuancecapable, to put it differently, of forgiveness, and of surmounting your own grievances in the interest of the humanthen you had to like Picasso. The last portrait in the show was a crayon self-portrait: a near-death mask, staring terrified and goggle-eyed into the abyss. The image of ninety-one-year-old Picasso goggling into the abyss, which was reproduced on the exhibit brochure, reminded me both of Jerry, and of Philip Roth, whose books Jerry had caused my mother to buy, and which I, too, had therefore read. Did it mean you were anti-Semitic if you didnt feel sorry for Philip Roth because shiksas didnt want to have sex with him? Jerry had called my mom a shiksa, and had also often spoken of ice queens. My mother also began to refer to ice queens, and to wiseasses, and occasionally told me to not be a wiseass: a thing she had never said before she met Jerry. I understood that, although my mother was a shiksa, she was not an ice queen. I wasnt an ice queen, either, and never would be. But would I be a shiksa when I grew up? Jerry called me the kid, and said I was spoiled because I was allowed to read during dinner: a thing I only did when he was there, to avoid having to talk to him. Once, he told my mother at a restaurantI heard him, even though I was readingthat she couldnt possibly understand how tenuous he felt in the world, knowing that the Holocaust could happen again any minute. He asked himself sometimes whether my mother would be the kind of person who would hide him from the Nazis, and he just wasnt sure. When I compared his lifethe multistory row house, the Italian sports car, the weekly squash game, the string quartet where he played a hundred-year-old violin, the two Harvard degrees and well-funded labto that of my mother, who had gone to med school at seventeen, autopsying dead drunkards in her gross anatomy class; who always got paid less than my father for doing the same amount of work, and now had two jobs and was constantly being berated by everyone; my mother, to whom colleagues routinely asked insane questions like whether she was personally acquainted with Yasser Arafats wife, or whether women in Turkey were allowed to wear bathing suitswhen I compared their lives, I wondered just what kind of protection this guy expected my mother to give him against the Nazis. Jerry eventually left my mother for one of the ice queens he had always complained about. Their wedding was on my mothers birthday. My mother said I didnt seem well. In fact, tears were streaming down my face. Im fine, I assured her. Its not related to anything. I had a belief that I had always cried this much. Hadnt we all laughed about it, when I was three? Adults would ask me what was the matter, and I would say I was moved. My mother said that I was incorrect; I had always had a tender heart, but I had not gone around like a stricken mask of tragedy. She talked about exciting work that was being done on antidepressants. We have to find a maven, she said, and resolved to get me the name of someone who knew about psychopharmacology. It was just what I had thought I hadnt wanteda referral to some guyand yet, hearing her talk about it as if it was already decided, I felt relief. Wont it be expensive? I asked. What? That is not an issue, she said, as if it was beneath consideration. On the way to the train station, my mother said that she wasnt going to wash my sheets after I left. Sometimes, she said, she slept in my bed for one or two nights, because the bed still smelled like me. She smiled conspiratorially, and I felt my heart constrict. December When I stopped by her room to pick her up to go jogging, Svetlana opened the door wearing just leggings and a sports bra. I hooked up with Matt, she said, indicating some red marks on her chest and shoulders. Was that hives? Who was Matt? Would I ever understand reality again? I felt relieved when Svetlana zipped up her fleece pullover. Maybe things would go back to normal. With some effort, I placed Matta genial, Dad-like dude who did a cappella. I used to see him at the Russian conversation table I had stopped going to, because the conversation was so boring. Nothing went back to normal. Matt was now Svetlanas boyfriend. I felt the same shameful emotions I had experienced in the past, when my aunts, mother, and father, in pursuit of various relationships, had brought more and more tedious people into our lives. Envy, jealousy, loneliness, despairand also a kind of guilt, mixed with relief. Insofar as Svetlana and I had been in competition, to see whose worldview was better... that was over. She would never again be what she had been, not in my life, and not in her own. This boyfriend, or his successor, would restrict her activities, her thoughts. In a way, I had won, but it felt like defeat. How could she drop out of the race, when we had only just started? How had they gotten her so easily? Did they get everyone? Would they get me? Did I want them to? There had been two guys at the Russian conversation table: Matt and Gavriil. I found Gavriil less off-putting than Matt. Was I supposed to date Gavriil? How were you supposed to know who to date? Gavriil and I were partners to write a Russian skit. As soon as we had sat down, he told me he had started seeing this girl, Katie. I knew Katie: she did art history, spoke fluent French, and looked like an adorable puppet. She seemed just as friendly as Gavriil, and cooler and more conventionally attractive. It became impossible to have a real conversation with Svetlana. On the plus side, Matt was good-natured and didnt have a self-esteem problem, so you didnt have to deal with him blaming you for making him feel stupid. On the other hand, the minute you tried to talk about anything interesting, he would swiftly, good-naturedly, inexorably change the subject back to one of the three kinds of things he ever talked about. Matt acted as if he enjoyed my company: a clear subterfuge to enable him to interrupt me and Svetlana whenever we were alone. He greeted me in a collegial fashion, recruited me to join him in jokes on the principle of: We all know what Svetlana is like. Then he would start kissing Svetlanas neck, causing me to feel like I was violating their privacy and embodying some kind of sterile bitterness. Once, when Matt was traveling with the Chorduroys and Svetlana and I were talking the way we used to, Svetlana surprised me by saying: This is the kind of conversation we cant have when Matt is around. I felt unutterable relieffinally, she had noticed that Matt wasnt fully capable of meaningful discourse!followed by sinking horror: Svetlana had always known, and she didnt care. Gavriil thought it was weird that last year my life had been so romantic and he and Svetlana hadnt had any adventures, but now he and Svetlana had romantic lives and I didnt. Dont you think thats weird? he asked. Katie got sick and refused to eat anything but strawberries. Gavriil bought her strawberries, which she ended up puking, and which he cleaned upbecause he loved her. He said in a fervent voice that he hoped that someday I would meet someone who would love me enough to clean up if I puked strawberries all over a bathtub. Lucas and I were talking about books we thought were funny, and he mentioned The Rachel Papers by Martin Amis. My mother and I had both read The Information by Martin Amis, and hadnt enjoyed it. Lucas said that The Rachel Papers was funnier, and he thought I would like it. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Lucas had any idea of me at all, let alone one that I could learn more about by reading a book. The Rachel Papers was about a nineteen-year-old guy who wanted to conquer this girl, Rachel, who he thought was out of his league. Later, after they had sex, he decided that she wasnt smart enough and had a big nose. Her nose made an appearance every few pages. The narrator seemed to take its existence personally, as if it was deliberately flaunting itself to remind him of the low social status that prevented him from conquering someone with a better nose. At one point, the nose added insult to injury by getting a pimple. When I opened my eyes to the bubbling big boy inches from my lips, I really should have said: Morning, beautiful. And seeing it half an hour later, matted with make-up, I really should have cried: Oh look. You havent got a spot on your nose! And, that evening, when Rachel announced: The curse is upon me (misquoting The Lady of Shalott), my answer should really have been: Surprise surprise. Listen, youve got it in italics right across your conk. I reread the passage, trying to identify where Rachel had made her mistake. Definitely, she shouldnt have used concealer: it looked worse and it clogged your pores. And probably it was pretentious to quote The Lady of Shalott instead of just saying you had your periodespecially if you didnt get the quote right. I looked up the correct quoteThe curse is come upon me, not The curse is upon meand filed it away for future reference. When I read the passage a third time, I understood that both the concealer and The Lady of Shalott were beside the point, since the narrator had become upset earlier, at the moment he first set eyes on the pimple. Maybe Rachels real problem was that she hadnt figured out what product to use so she wouldnt get pimples. I had noticed an improvement in my own complexion after I started using seven-dollar pore-refining cleanser. Later on the page, though, the narrator said something that implied that he believed that all people sometimes got pimples. So, the problem couldnt be getting the pimple, but reacting to it wrongly: failing to acknowledge it. Then it seemed to me that Rachel had participated in the genteel, life-denying hypocrisy, in the reluctance to speak frankly about menstruation or the body, that I had occasionally seen condemned in English novels. It seemed related to her refusal to give the narrator a blow job, even after he shoved his penis in her face (almost up her nose). She had owed him thatshe had owed him to take the penis out of her nose and put it in her mouthbecause he had been selfless enough to give her oral sex, even though it had been disgusting. (It was too dark there (thank God) for me to be able to see what was right in front of my nose, just some kind of glistening pouch, redolent of oysters.) At the end, the narrator got into Oxford, and dumped Rachel by writing her a letter. Rachel came over and cried, which made her nose look shiny. After she left, the narrator started writing a story from the perspective of a girl who was getting a PMS pimple. That was itthat was the whole book. I tried to summarize my takeaways. The curse is come upon me; avoid concealer; be the writer. Why had Lucas liked this book? It was, I supposed, good on a sentence level. (Was it, though? Could an oyster-redolent pouch glisten in the dark?) And didnt reading it make a person feel worse? Did it not make Lucas feel worse? Or was evoking a bad feeling somehow the artistic point? What if the only reason I hadnt liked the book was that I was a girl, and had a big nosethat it was a subject I was sensitive about, and I had a personal bias that I had to overcome if I wanted to appreciate the book objectively on its own terms, as Lucas had been able to do? For some reason, I found myself thinking back to the time when I was twelve and went to stay with my mother for the weekend in Philadelphia, and found her face black and bruised and bandaged, as if she had been beaten. It turned out that Jerry had said that my mother would be classically beautiful if she had a different nose, and, when she laughed and said she couldnt afford a nose job, he had paid for it himself. Jerry was a short bald man with a visibly bad personality, and my mother was beautiful, and he had broken her face. Yet, my mother was happy with her new nose, and seemed to think of the whole episode as an example of something positive that Jerry had done. One of the things my fathers lawyer had later said, when he was trying to prove that my mother was an unfit parent, was that she might force me to get plastic surgery. This statement somehow made me suspect that my father didnt like my nose. My mother always said that my nose was completely different from hers, and much more elegant. If her nose had been like mine, she would never have changed it. I wasnt sure if it was true, since I couldnt remember what her old nose had looked like, and none of the pictures from that time seemed to show her nose clearly. Lakshmi said that, although Martin Amis had made some contributions to postmodern literature, The Rachel Papers was quite juvenile, and she wasnt surprised that I hadnt liked it. Lakshmi, whose nose resembled mine, said she wasnt against the idea of having work done someday. The conversation turned to Orlan, the conceptual artist whose art form was getting plastic surgeries based on famous paintings. She already had the forehead of the Mona Lisa and the chin of Botticellis Venus, and looked terrifying. Apparently, one question people asked about Orlan was whether she was really an artist, or just a mentally ill person being exploited by surgeons. I couldnt think at first who Orlan reminded me of, then realized it was the guy in Against Nature. Her project seemed theoretically cool, but in practice somehow gross and pointless. Lakshmi explained that the point was to critique the male artistic convention of creating an ideal woman by recombining different parts of famous beauties. Orlan was showing how, if you took literally the things that were said by dumb men, you ended up at something gross and dangerous. Isnt that literally cutting off your nose to spite your face, though? I asked. Whose nose did she get, anyway? Lakshmi took a folded-up photocopy out of her handbag. She actually had an article about Orlan on her person. A famous, unattributed School of Fontainebleau sculpture of Diana, she read. We both burst out laughing. I said I thought it would be more efficient to just ignore society and dumb men. Lakshmi said that, according to French feminist theory, you couldnt ignore the men, because their views on women were baked into culture at such a deep level. Just by using words, you were perpetuating their ideas, because they were the ones who had made up language. So what are you supposed to do? Not use words? Well, they say that women have to make up their own language, and their own kind of writing, outside of the patriarchal hegemony. I stared at her. Youre joking. No, not at all. Its called criture fminine. I looked up criture fminine in a dictionary of literary theory. The people who had thought it up apparently didnt like to define it, because definitions were part of Western phallogocentric rationalism. criture fminine wasnt the opposite of phallogocentrism, exactly, because the idea of opposites and binaries was also something men had come up with, in order to dominate and exploit nature. Rather, criture fminine set out to shatter those binaries, opening up a new area of discourse, free play, and chaos. The idea of opening up a new language seemed exciting. On the other hand, I never had been a huge fan of free play or chaos. Nor did I feel like my main problem with other people or the external world was an excess of logic. The more I read about criture fminine, the less appealing it sounded. It was characterized, I learned, by textual disruptions, puns, etymologies, and slippery metaphors like milk, orgasm, menstrual blood, and the ocean. It worked by celebrating mother figures and the multiplicity of the feminine, defying the fetish of the sole objective God-father-author-truth, supplanting the unified phallus with the two lips which embrace continually of the female sex. That was a quote from Luce Irigaray, who also noted that collaboration was etymologically related to labia and that womens lips were always touching each other in collaboration. What if I didnt want to collaborate that way? What if I wanted to use logic, by myself, in an objective waywithout mothers or menstrual blood? A feminine textual body is recognized by the fact that it is always endless, without ending: theres no closure, it doesnt stop, and its this that very often makes the feminine text difficult to read, wrote Hlne Cixous, in a sentence that could definitely have been shorter. I didnt get it: why did we have to write stuff that was hard to read and didnt have an ending, just because men were wrong? At dinner, Oak said he had switched his major to Folklore and Mythology, which had the fewest requirements. I set out my views on the arbitrariness of departments, and on how there should be a department of love. Ezra told a story about a kid in his computer science lecture class who had asked, about some algorithmEzra assumed the shrewd, hard-hitting manner of someone unafraid to ask the tough questionsBut is it capable of love? Ezras basketball friend, Wei, said that he had been teaching a section on the lambda calculus, and one freshman had hung around afterward, apparently yearning to get something off his chest, before finally blurting: When do we learn about the lamb? Wei spoke rarely, but always said something interesting. Oak, who never seemed to have anything to do or anywhere to be, walked Priya and Riley and me back from dinner. Are you OK? Riley asked Priya, who kept staring at the sky. I just cant tell if its raining, she said. It could be Selins Finnish friend doing a thought experiment, Riley said. That was what she always said now, whenever we werent sure if something was really happening. A note addressed to Riley was taped to our door. Rileys face lit up in a way I had only ever seen when cats were involved. Is that from Lucas? Oak asked. Riley cast her eyes girlishly downward. Riley likes Lucas! said Oak. From the fact that Riley didnt contradict him, I understood that she not only liked Lucas, but felt confident that Lucas liked her, too. I felt dumb for never having considered the possibility that Riley might eventually pair off with one of her guy friends. Now it seemed obvious. Obviously all the girls, whether they talked about it or not, were on the lookout for any reprieve from the hassle of not having a boyfriend: the way it exposed you to censure and nosiness. This thing with the boyfriendsit wasnt a passing fad. Nothing would go back to how it had been. It would become more and more like the way it was. The stakes would get higher, the choices more limited. There were to be no exciting private discoveries of another person. Any option that occurred to you was bound to have occurred to others, embroiling you in a strugglelike the struggle between Zita and Eunice, which I had entered, without even realizing it. Lucas was funny, tall, polite, and didnt say or do gross things. He was such an obvious candidate. I reflected back on all the polite, kind things he had ever said to me. Why had the thought never crossed my mind? It crossed my mind now, but I dismissed it, since Riley liked him. My mother got me a referral to a psychiatrist in one of the gazillion teaching hospitals in Boston. You took the Red Line to Park Street and changed to the Green Line. The Red Line went underground and felt like a subway, but the Green Line came aboveground and started to feel like a streetcar. In ancient times, this had been a charitable lying-in hospital for virtuous ladies of straitened means. The prostitutes had gone to a different hospital. The building was way more upscale than the one in Brooklyn where my mother worked. High over the street, busy-looking people in scrubs or white coats were clutching coffee cups, striding along a glassed-in walkway. The psychiatry department was in a basement and had no windows. It smelled like the hall outside my moms lab. Was someone keeping rabbits down here? The psychiatrist was thin, middle-aged, balding, and wore a white coat. He sat behind a desk in a leather executive chair. I sat in one of three less expensive chairs in front of the desk. What brings you here today, he said, with an expression devoid of curiosity. I think Im depressed, I said. What makes you think that? I cant stop crying. He asked about my familys history of physical and mental illnesses. I realized that, although I felt that I knew my familys history, there were a lot of questions I couldnt answer. It was like looking in a drawer and finding it empty. I remembered that a great-aunt had killed herself, but why? A lot of people had cancer. The psychiatrist looked at me sharply. Who has cancer? I found that, notwithstanding my feeling that our house had constantly been full of people who had cancer, I couldnt name any of them, except my grandfather and aunt, and now my mother. Was the treatment successful? he asked, about my aunt and my mother, sounding like he was criticizing me for not being sufficiently concerned. He went down a list of routine questions: whether I had been dropped on the head as a child, had seizures, or received special messages from the radio or television; whether I was sexually active, did drugs, thought I would be better off dead, or planned to hurt myself or others. I said no to everything, notwithstanding my wish, passionate at times, to be dead. It seemed clear that the only part he cared about was the planthe plan to hurt myself (though it was really the opposite; it was a plan to stop being hurt). Better off deadas if the whole point wasnt to opt out, once and for all, from the question of how to be well-off, or better-off. But I didnt have a plan, I wasnt going to do it: partly because it would be the same thing as murdering my mother, and her sister, and then what would happen to my cousin; and partly out of fear that I would fail, and then people would say it had been a cry for help. Which is exactly what it would be if I told this guy about it now. Did you like school? asked the psychiatrist. No. A look of displeasure flickered over his face. Why not? The inexpressible twelve-year panorama of school rose before me. It was basically torture, I said. There was something he objected to, or didnt believe. But you must have been a successful student, he said. I couldnt think when I had last met a more unpleasant person. I wondered whether I was having resistance. Was he telling me things I had repressed for some reason? If I accepted them, would I feel better? I actually think most of the people in my family are depressed, I said at some point, realizing the truth of the statement only as I said it. Are they being treated? the psychiatrist asked, making it sound like the lowest baseline of responsible behavior. I told him that I thought my mother went to a psychiatrist. He asked for how long. At first, I was going to say that it had only been since the court made her move back to New Jersey. But then I remembered that, during the custody suit, she had asked a psychiatrist in Philadelphia to give her a character reference. So there had been a psychiatrist in Philadelphia. He had told my mother that the only thing he felt able to tell the court was that she had left one masochistic relationship with my father, to go straight into another masochistic relationship with Jerry. So your mother left your father and you. What was that like for you? asked the psychiatrist, causing me to realize that, like most people, he was going to criticize and blame my mother, and my heart shut off to him completely. But I still sat there and answered the questions; I didnt get up and walk out. Was that because of social conventions? Or did part of me still hope that he knew something I didnt? It finally happened, Svetlana said. I had sex with Matt. And afterwards I thought, today this really important step in my life has taken place. But how is it physically different than if yesterday I had just jammed in a banana? The dining hall seemed to have just gotten a shipment of particularly large and underripe bananas. Rigid and green-tinged, they were sharply curved at one end and less curved at the other, which gave them a smirky, jawlike aspect. To me, an apple had been the obvious choice. But Svetlana had taken a banana, and was holding it up now. Its literally the same thing, she said. I eyed the banana, estimating its girth at about six times that of a tampon. And yet, Svetlana wasnt the kind of person who used literally to mean figuratively. As usual, she seemed to know what I was thinking. It turns out Matt has a really big one, she said, in a tone of combined exasperation, humor, and pride. But, like... I glancedeloquently, I feltat the banana. I know, I was so surprised. Its weird how you cant tell what size a guy is going to be. But how did you... How did it... Well, it was excruciatingly painful, especially the first time. But after two or three times, it basically goes in. You dont feel like its possible, but obviously your bodys capacity is greater than your awareness of it. I mean, the circumference of a babys head is thirty-five centimeters. I felt a wave of despair. Svetlana asked if I thought she looked different. I did. Her face seemed softer, rounder. She was wearing a white cardigan I didnt recognize, and the white seemed to hold a different meaning than it would have before. Svetlana said that sex was different from what you expecteddiscontinuous from making out. It was something you couldnt imagine in advance and was clearly, like everything else, going to take practice. The only part that was already exciting and satisfying was being able to see Matts desireto have clear evidence of being so desired. As a woman, you can hide your desire from another person, or be unaware of it yourself, she said. I felt confused. Didnt men also conceal their desires from themselves and others? But its different for a guy, she continued, because his desire has such a visual and tangible reality. Then I understood she was talking about an erection. Desire seemed so metaphoric and wide-ranging, and an erection seemed so literal and specific. Was that really what desire was: the thing that was signified by an erection? As if according to schedule, Gavriil told me he had had sex with Katie. He felt like he was good at sex, but worried that he couldnt know, and felt troubled by how much more mysterious sex was for women than it was for men. How so? I asked. Well, for a guy, its always the same. But for a woman... its different every time. I had no idea what he was talking about. Do you mean, like, the result is different? Or the process? Thats just it! he said. The longer we talked, the more I felt like he was asking me for some kind of advice or information. It seemed almost like he was asking whether I thought Katie had had real orgasms, or whether she had been faking. But how could I know that? Svetlana said that Katie was definitely faking orgasms. Even Svetlana, with her refusal to distort herself into acceptable forms, had felt a powerful compulsion to fake. Sex was radically different from making yourself come. What you had learned with yourself didnt translate. There were too many things to think about, and you werent in control; you had to relinquish control. This was true even if you were on top. Therefore, you basically never had an orgasm. When Matt used his hand, it actually felt distracting, because penetration was such a different feeling from clitoral stimulation, and it took all a persons concentration to understand it. The two feelings did seem to converge somewhere, especially when you were lying on your stomach, so maybe that was the way it would eventually happen. The impetus for faking was more complicated than it seemed. It wasnt just to relieve Matts performance anxiety. It was also about Svetlanas anxiety. A guys problem-free ability to orgasm from sex had something demoralizing about it. It could make you feel blocked, inadequate, and frigid. Svetlana knew she wasnt any of those things. There were moments when she felt a deep current flowing through her body, stronger than anything Matt could fathom, and she knew that when she tapped into it, it would flatten them both like a tidal wave. She was afraid of it, but she knew she had to get there, and would get there. But there were also moments when she felt despair, when it felt like it was always out of grasp, and she understood why they called it reaching for the brass ring. To fake it would be to give in to the despair, and that was something she was never going to do. Riley disappeared for two weeks, because Lucas had his own room, and she was always staying in Mather. Then, one of Oaks geologists, Beau, got back together with his high school girlfriend, who went to a small liberal arts college where they encouraged peoples personalities and didnt care whether they went to classes. That girl, Becca, basically moved into their suite and was always there, monitoring the guys schedule, actually washing the towels. Becca was one of those people who either couldnt tell or didnt care that she was infuriating Riley, and had tried to give Riley pointers to help her be less negative. As a result, Riley stopped going to Mather, and Lucas started staying over in our room, sleeping with Riley in the bottom bunk. It was a situation we never discussed or acknowledged. We might all be talking companionably enough at an earlier stage in the evening, but, once everyone was in their beds, it was like we werent aware of each others existence. Riley and Lucas whispered between themselves, and I never did feel like I could just chime in with an observation about whatever I had just been reading. After the psychiatrist, I always cried on the T. If you betrayed embarrassment or made a production of wiping your eyes, people stared, or asked if you were OK, or aggressively looked away in a way that made you feel guilty. But if you acted like nothing was happening, you floated on a magical cushion of invisibility. Maybe people didnt notice, or they thought you just had an eye problem. It was always hard to reconstruct the conversation that had upset me so much. Only snippets stuck in my mind. Like when the psychiatrist asked: Why are all these details so precious to you? What do you mean? I asked. What is so precious to you in this story with this Hungarian fellow? Why are you holding on to it? It reminded me of something I had read in Freud, about how misers hoarded gold the way children hoarded excrement. Was that what this guy was saying that I was doing? Was that what psychiatry was about? Was it related to toilet training? Did I have to think about toilet training? The word precious made me think of Gollum in The Hobbit, who represented all that was the most base in human nature. Why was precious bad? Why was it an insult for writing to be precious? Was it wrong to value thingsto want to keep them? If so, how did I get free from it? If this guy was telling me to not value something, wasnt he obliged to offer me something better? Later, I was back in that hospital basement, trying to describe my feeling of the world being a huge soul-crushing sex conspiracy that I didnt know how to be a part of. The psychiatrist looked at me dispassionately and said: Do you think you are attractive to men? I gaped. Was he being cruel, or just dumb? I had told him that nobody had ever kissed me, or asked me out. And anyway, he himself could see me. Here I was. No, I said. Impatience flickered over his face. Why not? I stared at him incredulously. How could he ask me to account for that? I had to experience it, and I had to explain it? Was he saying it was my fault? At the T stop, I stared fixedly ahead, as tears streamed down my face, and my nasal passages shut down. Was this the work you had to do? Was I getting better? My mother asked about therapy. I told her I cried a lot afterward and usually couldnt remember why, so maybe it was working. Hmm, my mother said, sounding unconvinced. What does he say about meds? Nothing. He hasnt mentioned anything? No. Did you tell him about the crying? Yeah. Next time, ask him about medication, she said. I didnt say anything. Are you going to ask him? But maybe he thinks I dont need it, I said. Isnt it like you only need it if you have a chemical imbalance? Surely, a brain was either chemically imbalanced, or it wasnt, and a trained professional could immediately tell the difference. Going to a psychiatrist couldnt be like going to a restaurant, where you told them what you wanted. And if it was like thatif antidepressants were something that wasnt objectively necessary, but was somehow optional... Sweetie, if it was optional to feel better, why would you not want to do it? my mother asked. But then why dont we all just do recreational drugs? My mother explained the reasons that we didnt all just do recreational drugs. Street drugs were highly addictive, so that over time you had to keep upping the dose to get the same effect, and got sick if you couldnt get it. They affected the control centers of the brain, leading to hazardous behavior, and were unregulated, so we didnt know what was in them. They were illegal, meaning that if you bought them, you were continuing a system that led to poverty and wars, and you yourself could end up in jail. None of these things were true of antidepressants. I was filled with admiration for how good my mother was at explaining things. My mother said that I was making this into a bigger deal than it was, because lots of people my age took antidepressants. My high school friend Shellys boyfriend, Aidan, was now doing very well on Lexapro. This information, which had originated with Shellys mother, was new to me. Aidan, whose father was a proctologist in what my parents called private practice, meaning that he cared about making money, had lived in a mansion in Watchung, and had been specially commended at our school for raising a hundred thousand dollars to protect elephants from ivory traders. He had always seemed so sure of himselfso sure of the wrongness of other people: of the elephant poachers, of the bands that were sellouts. It was true that once he had cried in front of the whole school, but it had been angrily, about the elephants. I had always thought of Aidan as being somehow spoiled and lacking in stamina, as not having real problems: if he had had real problems, how could he have been so upset about the elephants? Was it possible that Aidan had ever felt the way I felt now? The possibility that lots of people my age were, unbeknownst to me, taking antidepressants made me think of the book Prozac Nation, which had come out when I was in high school. Anything with nation or generation in the title already seemed to be hectoring a personabout how we as a nation didnt, for example, deal with our problems anymore, choosing to just pop a pill. By deal with our problems, they meant, suck it up. I disliked people who said suck it up. On the other hand, I also disliked laziness, and it had been impressed upon me many times that we were on a slippery slope to a situation where everyone was in an incubator being drugged to not think for themselves, like in Brave New World. I wasnt sure which of those two things the book was going to behectoring, or incubatorbut either way I hadnt felt like reading it. I knew that the author of the book, the girl who had taken Prozac, had gone to Harvard, and was viewed as the voice of a generation. Generation X: that was the people who were going around being alternative when I was in middle school. Her photograph was on the cover. Waiflike, with long, tousled hair, she bore a marked resemblance to Fiona Apple. At the time, I had found this all off-putting. But now I somehow wanted to know what the book said. I found it in the library catalogProzac Nation: Young and Depressed in America. In America was also annoying, as if everything that happened to you was somehow about America. The library had two copies. Both were checked out. I ended up going to the basement to look up old book reviews. It felt dramatic to sit in the dark, spooling microfilm into the large, continually exhaling, annoyed-seeming machine. It was impossible to regulate the rate at which the weeks of the New York Times scrolled by, between screaming warp speed and barely moving. Skimming the review, which was called The Examined Life Is Not Worth Living Either, and which appeared in the same issue as the American invasion of Haiti, I remembered more clearly why I hadnt wanted to read the book when it came out. The author, Elizabeth Wurtzel, was described as a precocious person, who had taken her first overdose at age eleven, and started cutting herself at age twelve. Some of my mothers friends had daughters who were anorexic, or did drugs, or cut themselves with razors. My mother would relate their exploits to me, her face a mask of horror, wondering aloud what would she do if I was like that. As if Id ever had time, even when I was twelve, to go around cutting myself with a razor. Anyway, I never had been able to understand how girls like that cared so little about worrying their parents. It occurred to me now to wonder whether my consideration for my parents had been motivated by cowardiceby fear of having my freedom further curtailed, in ways that Elizabeth Wurtzel would not have tolerated. Surely she would have run away to do drugs with her cool friends. Was that why I felt animosity toward her: because she was braver and more resourceful than I was? It wasnt a positive review. Ms.Wurtzel spares us no detail about her life, Michiko Kakutani wrote. It was the same critique Andr Breton had leveled at Nadja: how she didnt hesitate to tell him all the vicissitudes of her life, not omitting a single detail. (So: it was important to spare people details.) For a person who supposedly didnt like complaining, Michiko Kakutani certainly complained a lot about Elizabeth Wurtzels attitude toward her parents divorce. At times, Ms.Wurtzels self-important whining made Ms.Kakutani want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the 70s in New York and going to Harvard. I read another review, by a man named Walter Kirn. The long moan begins with Wurtzels parents, who split when she was 2. The complaint itself was stretched with adjectival filler. Apparently, there was a link between the kind of self-indulgence that made people whine about their childhood, and the kind that made writers fail to murder their darlings. Both came from not having enough problems: from dragging around slights that had happened when you were two, and padding them with adjectives. Walter Kirn said that, by refusing to avoid self-indulgence, Elizabeth Wurtzel was turning her back on the formal lesson of her hero Plaths poetry, which was that hysteria has more impact when its contained, and sadness in art needs strict borders to press up against; otherwise, its just a muddy overflow. It was a familiar, incontrovertible line of reasoning: you couldnt just dump everything on a page, because it wouldnt be art. Yet there was something newly troubling to me, as it had not been when I was in high school, in this story of a girl who had gone to Harvard, and was depressed because her parents were divorced, and had written a book that was widely critiqued as self-indulgent. I wanted to ask about antidepressants, I told the psychiatrist. To my surprise, he immediately asked if I wanted him to write me a prescription. I dont know, I said. Would it help? It might. I stared at him. If he had known of something that might help me, then why hadnt he mentioned it? Is there a downside to trying it? As with any medication, there are side effects. The one most people worry about, especially women, is weight gain. But some people actually lose weight. Others dont encounter side effects at all. I had never before heard this man sound so interested in anythingespecially when he said some people actually lose weight. I started taking half of the lowest adult dose of Zoloft every other day. A few days in, I was walking to the Ukrainian Research Institute while listening to Cowboys, the B-side of the Killing Me Softly single. Most of the song was those guys rapping, but it didnt feel off-putting, partly because of the evocative background music, and partly because of the guys attitude toward cowboys. When one of them said that he shot John Waynepushing him off the runaway train, like in the movie ShaneI laughed out loud. I had forgotten about Shane. My mother had rented it on video for me, because she had loved it as a child. I had stared in disbelief as a blond boy, who looked like one of the assholes from my school, ran around with a gun, pouting and bleating, Shane! Shane!because he loved this grown man who went around shooting people. How, I remembered thinking, had my mother not seen that those people were losers? Pras and Young Zee saw it. Me and that kid, uh, whats his name? To think there were American people, men, who found cowboys as alienating and foreign as I did! There was a part where Lauryn Hill rapped a verse, with her friend Rashia. The most interesting parts were about their own technical competencetheir style. My style is indeed one of the foulest, one of them said. I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice. I had a thought that was so surprising that I stopped in my tracks. Was it possible that Zoloft would cause me to like rap music? PART THREE Spring Semester January Lakshmi and I were on a shuttle bus to Woods Hole. Who were these dour New Englanders? The shiksas and the ice queens, presumably, and their more numerous male counterparts. One of these he-shiksas, a balding man who looked exactly like my psychiatristwas it possible he was my psychiatrist?criticized me for talking too loudly. You do realize that your voice is booming through the entire bus, he said. Since it had been framed more as an observation than a request, I decided to counter it with one of my own. Its a bus, not a library, I said. Selin! Lakshmi whispered, seeming scandalized, but also laughing. I went back to the story I had been telling her in what I considered to be a normal speaking voice. At first, I couldnt understand why nobody but me and Lakshmi wanted to sit on the outer deck. Then, the ferry started to move and we bowed our heads before the life-annihilating wind that gusted over the surface of the Atlantic. Lakshmi, undaunted, hunched over and somehow lit a cigarette inside her suede coat. When she stood up again the wind whipped the cigarette out of her hands and it immediately disappeared. We had decided to spend intersession in Marthas Vineyard. I had made a reservation at a bed-and-breakfast, but Lakshmi turned out to have a categoric objection to bed-and-breakfasts and seemed surprised that I would even consider staying in one. She said we would surely find a place to crash. Even when our one leadsome friends of Isabelles parentsfell through, she was unfazed, saying that, once we got there, someone would invite us to stay with them. This made no sense to me. Neither of us knew anyone in Marthas Vineyard, so why would anyone invite us to stay with them? And, if they did, why would we do it? I just have a good feeling, Lakshmi said, as we disembarked the ferry. The thought of anyone having a good feeling in this obviously deserted place, where the lack of sentient life forms was compensated only by a bizarre excess of flagpoles, struck me as outrageous. Lakshmi said that in the worst case, we could spend the night somewhere that was open twenty-four hours, like an emergency room, and try again tomorrow. It wasnt five yet but was almost completely dark. Only a few buildings had lights on. Lakshmi confidently strode past the first twoa bar and a hoteland stopped at the third, a fitness club, where she struck up a conversation with two blond girls who came out toting squash rackets. Lakshmi asked about the fitness club and its hours, segueing to the question of places to stay. To my astonishment, the girls promptly invited us to stay with them. Elsa and Malin were identical twins, though Malin was somehow prettier. They had come to Marthas Vineyard two summers ago, from Uppsala, having heard how much money you could make, and had stuck around for the off-season, doing odd jobs, renting a house for almost nothing from a guy who had to pretend for some legal reason to live there, though he really lived somewhere else. Are men really into how youre twins? Lakshmi asked. Oh, its totally a fetish for some guys, Malin said. Theyre like, Swedish twins, Elsa said, meaningfully. The understanding was that the twins could stay with us the next time they were in Boston. What do we do if they actually show up? I whispered to Lakshmi, when we were finally alone, in the spare room with the giant lobster mural. Lakshmi shrugged. They can stay in our common rooms. You take Elsa, Ill take Malin. I couldnt help laughing. It was comical how Lakshmi liked Malin better. Lakshmi was still in love with Noor, but had started dating Jon, a senior who wrote fiction and had a short story in almost every issue of the literary magazine. I had never successfully read one of his stories. Lakshmi said that Jon was too good-looking and smart for her. I should probably dump him, she said. If I wait too long, Ill get dumped. Jon, who lived off-campus, had cooked dinner for her. Was it good? I asked. It was fine. She dispassionately described the mushroom risotto, the Pinot Noir, the candles, and the vase of carnations. I said it seemed like a lot of trouble to take, if he didnt actually like her. No, its part of his whole thing. What thing? Like, he stares into my eyes and says Im a mysterious exotic beauty, and he cant decipher me. Guys must say stuff like that to you, too. You know: youre an exotic Eastern beauty, full of mystery. They did not. I kind of think you just are an exotic Eastern beauty full of mystery, I said. Its orientalist bullshit, Lakshmi said, tilting up her chin in a way that made her cheekbones stand out. Her mouth looked especially flowerlike and contemptuous and beautiful. Malin offered to take us riding at the stables where she worked, if we helped her clean out the stalls. They thought I was joking when I said I didnt know how to ride a horse. Lakshmi borrowed an entire riding outfit, and looked like someone in a period drama. Later, Malin and Elsa were in a panicespecially Elsa. Due to a misunderstanding with an architect they worked for, they had to immediately walk a dog, while collecting a large quantity of flat rocks from the beach. We all got into their used Volvo and drove across the island. The architects house was a long, low box made of wood and glass. Everything about it seemed evocative and expensive, except the dog, which looked less like a dog than like a panicked homunculus that had been crammed into an ill-fitting shaggy suit. Malin opened the glass sliding door and the dog sailed out over the dunes and started doing everything at once: peeing and frolicking and scrabbling in the sand. There was the ocean, like a recurring character you forgot about for long stretches. Of the five big flat rocks that I lugged back to the house, I couldnt tell the difference between the two that met with Elsas approval, and the three that didnt. Lakshmi seemed to view the unearthing of rocks as a matter outside her sphere of concern, and only dug halfheartedly with her toe in the sand. The crashing waves and the hiss of encroaching foam produced a meaningful, cinematic atmosphere. That night, the twins had a double date with some local fetishists and said we could use their hot tub. They loaned us bikinis. I couldnt get my bikini top to stay put, so I just wore the bottom. Lakshmis bikini fit her perfectly. Steam rose over the surface of the glowing blue. All around us was blackness. When had I last seen so many stars? Was this depressing, or was it fun? The night we got back to campus, Matt was still on tour with the Chorduroys. Svetlana and I sat for three hours after dinner, addressing a wide range of questions. What was a Swedish twin fetish? Was the idea to have sex with both of them? Did they have sex with each other? I recognized the plausibility of Svetlanas hypothesis, which was that they didnt have sex with each other, but they did make out. Was that incest? Could an otherwise heterosexual person be attracted to their identical twin? Was narcissism good, bad, or neutral? Why was Narcissus a boy and not a girl? What role did personality and expectations play in determining a persons fate? Lakshmi had expected strangers to invite us to stay with them in Marthas Vineyard, and the expectation had come true. Neither Svetlana nor I would have expected such an outcome, or known how to bring it about. Later, I was recounting a chili cook-off Malin and Elsa had brought us to. So then Chili Con Blarney said to the Red Hot Chili Preppers, I began, but was laughing too hard to finish the story. You know, Selin, Svetlana said, I think the Zoloft is definitely having a positive effect. I felt shocked. Neither of us had mentioned the Zoloft, not since I told her I was taking it. I knew that Svetlana herself had declined to take anti-anxiety medications, saying that she wanted to understand her anxiety from the inside, not change it from the outside. But now she was looking at me with affection. I missed this Selin, she said. It hadnt occurred to me that she had missed me, too. I decided to try to take a creative writing classless because I thought I would learn anything, than as a way to convert homework time into writing time. There were two fiction classes. One was taught by a famous writer. You had to go to an introductory meeting, just to learn how to apply. I got there early, but all the seats in the auditorium were already taken. People were sitting on the steps and standing against the walls. The famous writer, who wore a scarf wrapped around her head, said she didnt care for this business with the applications, but it had to be done to keep the numbers manageable. With this in mind, she had an assignment for us. She wanted us to write a description of our bed. Quite a simple thing: your bed, she said, speaking slowly and clearly. About a hundred people raised their hands. Could the bed be any bed we had ever slept in? What about a bed from history? What counted as a bed? Did it have to have legs? Looking mildly surprised, the writer said that she supposed we could write about anything that we considered a bed, though she had imagined us writing about the bed in which we ourselves usually woke in the morning. How long should it be? someone asked. Fatigue flickered over the writers face. It should be as long as it takes you to simply describe your bed. The thought of writing anything about my bedbrimming with foam earplugs, overhung by the duct-taped canopy, with a roll of toilet paper wedged against the wallwas deeply dispiriting. Nor was this feeling, on examination, specific to that bed. I didnt want to describe any furniture. I didnt want to describe my bedroom, or anyone elses bedroom, or my childhood home, or a place I knew well. I wanted to write a book about interpersonal relations and the human condition. Looking at the writer, at her face that emanated a kind of humane but blocked-off weariness, I felt a profound conviction that she herself couldnt possibly want to read like a hundred descriptions of what was, essentially, the same dorm-issue bed. Of her many books, I had read only her first novel, set in a former British colony, based on her own childhood, which had sounded so much more difficult than mine that I had felt guilty and ashamed. Now she had to hear about my bed? I ended up applying to the other fiction class. It was taught by an American man who wasnt famous. There was no introductory meetingyou just had to drop off a writing sample about whatever you wanted. Lakshmi said that the problem with Jon was that eventually he was going to want to have sex. I wasnt sure why it was a problem. But Im going to be a virgin when I get married, Lakshmi said. I was astounded. Of course I knew that some people were specifically planning not to have premarital sex, but Lakshmi hadnt struck me as one of them. But what about Noor? I asked. Nothing ever happened with Noor, she said. I frowned, wondering if there was any way to ask her whether that had been the plan, or if the plan had been something else. So you dont think you have to know youre sexually compatible with someone, before you decide to get married? That wasnt the right question, either. I didnt know how to ask about what I wanted to know, which was what rules she was following, and with what expectations, and how she had come up with the rules and the expectations. But Im having an arranged marriage. Lakshmi seemed even more surprised by my surprise than I was by this new information. She said it wasnt new. You knew about my sister, she pointed out. This was true: Lakshmis older sister had married the son of a family friend, in a big wedding with fireworks and a white horse. But almost the first thing Lakshmi had ever told me about her sister was that she wasnt an intellectual. It wasnt the same as not being intelligent; she was brilliant at entertaining and decorating and fashion, and a person really had to be smart to be good at those things. But she didnt care about books. To me, it made sense that someone who cared more about entertaining than about books might have an arranged marriage. But Lakshmi said that it wasnt related to your interests. Everyone in her whole extended family had had an arranged marriage. It wasnt something you thought about doing, or not doing. Marriage was arranged marriage. What if you dont want to get married? But I do want to. I think living alone is really difficult, especially for a woman. I admire people who do it, but its not for me. Anyway, I want to have children. Feeling increasingly like the idiot friend from an American after-school special, I asked if she didnt want to choose her husband, to marry for love. Lakshmi said that dating and romance were fun when you were young, but that freedom of choice in love was an illusion, and caused only pain. Sartre had explained this: to choose was to be never secure, to be always in fluxto be, for a woman, as Simone de Beauvoir had shown, in a kind of nonexistence. Maybe Sartre had been happy, but Simone de Beauvoir hadnt. And even if she had been, it wasnt for Lakshmi. Furthermore, when it came to choice, Lakshmis father valued her so highly that he would demand more for her than she could ever demand for herself. He called her a rare pearl, a priceless roseshe couldnt repeat the overblown way he talked about her. Her sister was the beauty of the family, taking after their mother, but Lakshmis father thought that Lakshmi, too, was beautiful, in a more idiosyncratic way, and she would have a Harvard degree, and she sang. (I learned this with surprise, I had never heard Lakshmi sing.) And the great advantage of an arranged marriage was that your husband was committing, not to you personally, but to the institution of marriageto his whole family, as well as to yours. That took a lot of pressure off your looks, which wouldnt last forever, and off the rest of you, too, because whose personality was enchanting enough to keep a man interested for sixty years? Lakshmis father sometimes joked about women who married for love: how much they must value themselves, to think they were more attractive than the sum total of all other womento think they were enough, without the institution of marriage, to keep a man faithful to them. He teased Lakshmi, asking if she thought of herself that way. I felt a wave of gratitude toward my parents, who would never have thought or said anything like that about me. On the other hand... that didnt mean it wasnt true. At the last minute, I went with Svetlana to a Pilates class. Lying in a sea of Lycra-clad girls all doing pelvic bridges, synchronously imitating the instructors huffing, rhythmic breathing, made it hard not to think about childbirth. For some reason, the person who came to my mind was my parents friends daughter, Dilek. When I was in middle school, Dilek had gotten engaged to a balding Turkish economist, a man who had what he called a sarcastic sense of humor. My father said in a fervent voice that Dilek finally seemed happy and stable, that she had finally found someone who really cared about her. Dileks pregnancy, even more than her wedding, was met by everyone in our families with a kind of tearful celebratory relief, like the end of some agonizing period of worry. The baby, Erol, was difficult, meaning that he screamed for twelve hours a day, sometimes sobbing until he vomited. It was pointed out, somehow humorously, that Dilek, too, had been a difficult baby, and had tortured her mother by screaming and crying and vomiting. When I asked why it was good that Dilek had had a baby, I was told: But if she hadnt had Erol, we wouldnt have Erol. I didnt have anything against Erol; he was a baby. But hadnt everyone gotten along fine without him? My mother said that Dilek hadnt gotten along fine. She had wanted Erol, she had missed him. When I brought up Dilek dropping out of her Ph.D. program, it was pointed out that Dilek had always quit things, ever since she was a little girl. My aunts said that she hadnt really wanted a career, or she would have managed to have one anyway, like my mother. My mother was often cited as evidence that it was possible to have both a well-adjusted child and a career. To imply otherwise was small-minded, even sexist. Nobody acted like the suffering of Dilek or the baby, which was clear to anyone who spent even five minutes with them, had invalidated in any way the celebratory view taken of her marriage and pregnancy. Now the Pilates instructor was talking about closing our rib cages. I often couldnt tell if the things she said about ribs were literal or figurative. It was a strange thing how people acted as if having a kid was the best thing that could happen to anyone, even though actual parents seemed to experience most of their childrens actual childhoods as an annoyance, which they compensated for by bossing them around. People with kids had to go to work every day, at boring, reliable jobs. On the plus side, work was an acceptable way to escape your children, without seeming to want to. The children, having no such escape, lived through long stretches of boredom and powerlessness, punctuated by occasional treats that they overvalued and freaked out over because the rest of their lives were so empty. Why was it important to keep doing that? Some people, usually men, talked about genetic programming, and said we couldnt deny our nature. This was supposed to be scientific. I didnt see how obeying our nature was scientific, since it was also our nature to die from smallpox and to be unable to fly. Religious people were the only ones who said openly that having kids was the purpose of lifesomething you did because God told you to, and because you had to outnumber people in other religions. That at least made sense, though it did seem sort of antisocial. But what if you werent religious? I had heard some secularist people talk about a civic duty to keep pace with the religious peopleto outnumber them in elections. But werent there more direct ways to affect the outcome of elections, other than physically birthing people who would vote the same way as you? My grandmothers housekeeper had told me that the reason I should have children was so they would take care of me when I was old. But I thought I would rather pay a preexisting person to take care of meas indeed seemed to be normal for educated peoplerather than creating a whole new person and making them do it for free. My parents said that the real reason to have children was love: the unforeseeable, unimaginable way you fell in love with your baby. This wasnt a satisfying answer, since it involved imagining something that you apparently couldnt understand until it happened to you. I also didnt see what there was to prevent a person from falling in love with something other than their own baby. Furthermore, whenever parents talked about love, some part of my brain switched off. They had their story, and they were sticking to it. The story was that they loved us with a love that we were incapable of understanding, and the reason things were the way they were was because they loved us so much. In the end, I thought the most likely explanation was that most of the people in the world just didnt know they were allowed not to have kids. Either that, or they were too unimaginative to think of anything else to do, or too beaten-down to do whatever it was they thought of. That had been a big reason why I had wanted so much to get into Harvard: Id been sure it would be full of fortunate, resourceful, courageous people who had some better-conceived plan for life that I could learn about. It was a great disappointment to find that, even at Harvard, most peoples plan was to have children and amass money for them. You would be talking to someone who seemed like they viewed the world as a place of free movement and the exchange of ideas, and then it would turn out they were in a huge hurry to get everything interesting over with while they were young. Hey, Selin, said a blond guy with a pouty expression, at the first meeting of the creative writing class. I recognized him, after a moment, as Lakshmis new suitor, Joey. Jon really had broken up with her, as she had predicted. I didnt see a huge difference between Joey and Jon: both were seniors, wrote short stories, and had blond hair. Lakshmi said I was crazy: Jon was smarter, more confident, had a better body, dressed betterand hadnt I seen his eyes? The next time I ran into Jon, I made a point of looking at his eyes. He immediately looked back at me with eyes that were piercingly blue and seemed to be shooting light out of them. Oh, sorry! I said, and quickly looked away. Gavriil asked whether I thought that women liked Jon better than Joey, because Jon was a jerk to women, and Joey was a nice guy. I felt irritated, understanding that it was girls responsibility to disinterestedly award ourselves to nice guysto guys whom other guys agreed were nice, because our opinion couldnt be trusted. What, if any, was the connection between the rising wave of annoyance that I felt, and the mental image of Joeys pouty, self-conscious facial expression? Was that expression something he could control, or was it just what his face was like? Every week in creative writing, we read two short stories: one by an actual writer, and another by one of us. The published stories were usually OK, but everything we wrote was awful. Why did we have to talk about it? All the suggestions felt random and performative. It was like we were all looking at a malformed sweater and saying, Maybe it would be better if it was a different color, or if it was actually made of ice. The most interesting part of class was when the teacher, Leonard, talked about what it was like to be a writer. I had never met a professional writer before, apart from my parents endocrinologist friend who wrote spy novels under a pseudonym. Leonard said that being a writer meant that you lived your life on the outside looking in. Whenever Leonard went to peoples houses, the men would be in the living room, talking about football, or the stock market. Leonard couldnt survive five minutes in there; he always ended up in the kitchen with the women. They were the ones talking about stuff he actually cared about: gossip, basically, about real or fictional people. Women were kind, so they never kicked him out, though he had no kitchen skills, beyond chopping things and opening jars. I, like all the girls and most of the boys in the class, smiled at this descriptionat how the women tolerated Leonard, despite his incompetence. But my smile felt a little mechanical. Why were the women always in the kitchen, and what was it that Leonard had forfeited by being with them? Why was he a writer, and they werent, when they cared about the same things? Why wasnt he better at cooking? Why was there something exciting about the brutishness of the men who only talked about sports and money? You never know who has what it takes, Leonard said, once. Youll be surprised later by who makes it. In Leonards first year of grad school, one of his classmates had written a perfect short story, about two guys in prison who trained fighting spiders. There had been no doubt in anyones mind that he, the author of the story about the spiders, would be the one to become a famous writer. Yet, the next three years had gone by without that guy writing anything that good again, and he still hadnt written a book. In a lot of ways, being a writer was about endurance more than talent. Writers, Leonard said, were not normal people. As a writer, you were never totally present. You were always thinking of how you would put a thing into words. You were constantly putting yourself on the line, and constantly being rejected. You betrayed the only people who really loved you. For this reason, the most honest advice anyone gave about becoming a writer was that, if you were capable of doing absolutely anything else, you should do that thing instead. I didnt get it. Wasnt everyone capable of doing something else? How was that a test of whether you should be a writer? From the way he talked, it was clear that Leonard considered himself to be a failure. Yet he had published two novels that could be found in bookstores, and was teaching at Harvard. Why did he act as if those things didnt count? A cool dude called Marlon, who had sideburns, wrote a story about a cool dude called Marvin, who sat on different sofas and at some point drank some beer. Leonard said, kindly: I think what we need to know about this story is whetherand I dont say this at all in a spirit of dismissivenessbut whether its a story about not being able to get laid. Because if it is, thats fine, but we need to know that thats what it is. Was that what my story was about? Leonard assigned us to read My First Goose by Isaac Babel. All the surface markersthe type, the layout, the tone with which Leonard had mentioned itindicated that it was a great and important story. The narrator, an intellectual, had been sent to join a Cossack military regiment. The Cossacks werent intellectuals. In this way, if in no other, they resembled Lakshmis sister. A Cossack soldier with long blond hair and a wonderful Ryazan face defaced the narrators suitcase and started farting at him. Other Cossack soldiers also made fart jokes. The narrator tried to read a copy of the newspaper Pravda, but was too distracted by the farting Cossacks, so he ordered the landlady to bring him something to eat. The landlady, whose farm had been requisitioned, looked at the narrator with dripping, half-blind eyes and said that she wanted to hang herself. The narrator responded by seizing and murdering a goose, and ordering her to roast it. After that, the Cossacks called the narrator brother, and they all fell asleep together in a hayloft. There were many things I could relate to in the story. I had spent a lot of my formative years trying to concentrate on what I was reading, while surrounded by blond boys with amazing faces who were farting at me. But I didnt see why the narrator had to murder a goose or be so rude to a disabled person. Was it because I knew that, no matter how rude I was and no matter how many geese I murdered, the respect and camaraderie of the towheaded farters would always be turned against me; that Imy name, my appearance, my beingwas part of what sustained that camaraderie? I knew that, by having these negative feelings, I was being simple and simplisticthat the story was being more complex, and thus more human, than I was. The closing lines were about the narrator having nightmares that night: proof that the story wasnt endorsing his actions, any more than it was judging them. Great literature didnt judge. It described complex individuals who were neither good nor bad. Oh, I knew how to get an A in English just as well as the next person. Lakshmi had ended things with Joey. What did you tell him? I asked. The truth. That he wasnt attractive enough or interesting enough. I tried to be more diplomatic at first. But he kept asking, Why, why. She imitated an American intonation when she said Why, in a way that was funny to me, even though I also talked like that. What did he say? He cried, she shot back. There was something funny about her unquestioning, righteous-seeming anger, its immediacy and abruptness. And yet, since early childhood, it had always been a part of my identity that I was the only person who didnt laugh when someone tripped on a banana peel. The only other people who didnt laugh were the openmouthed people who never laughed at anything. Yet there was something about Joeys expression, its combination of sensitivity and hurt and lack of imagination, that made me feel less sorry for him than I wanted to. I knew that Svetlana thought that I deceived myselfthat I pretended to feel pity for people, when I actually felt contempt. Ivan had said something like that, too. I guess youre going to feel sorry for the dog. What had Ivan been accusing me of, that time with the dog? Being excessively sorry? Pretending to be sorrier than I was? Indulging in empty sorriness-feeling without backing it up with action? Ivan was the kind of person who thought it was funny when someone tripped on a banana peel. In this, I felt certain that he was incorrect. Poor Joey, I said aloud. He doesnt really care about me, just about his own idea of himself, Lakshmi said, opening a new and painful line of thought. Did Joey care more about his idea of himself than he did about the actual Lakshmi? Who was the actual Lakshmiother than someone who didnt care much for Joey? What would Joey act like if he really cared about her? Did Joeys pursuit of Lakshmi betray some fundamental misunderstanding of who she was? Had I missed the point of Ivan? Did I care more about my idea of myself than I did about him? February I went to a party that Lakshmi organized at the literary magazine. She was greeting people at the door, smiling dazzlingly through fake eyelashes. You came! And whats this? She touched the velvety material of my skirt. Finally youre wearing something that shows your body. My aunt had bought me the skirt and matching top over winter break, from the DKNY section in Bloomingdales. They were made of some velvety, lush, yet drapey and elastic material, soft to the touch, reminding me of my childhood toy koala, Tombik, whose white fluffy ears I had thought of, again and again, as perfect for crying into. Usually, when clothes were attractive in such a superficial wayby being so soft, or sparkling, or having a built-in hoodthey ended up looking stupid, in a particular way that made you see that you had been duped. But this time it wasnt like that. The two pieces were so sinuously and gently clingy, without being tight. The way the skirt hung looked intentional, almost sentient. The cost for the two items, over three hundred dollars, had struck me as obscenehow was a person allowed to have something like that? Seeing the garments hanging in Rileys and my closet made me feel sorrowful and moved almost to tearshow soft they were, how full of comfort, what a sign of the love that my family had always given me. Someone had put on an Ella Fitzgerald CD. It produced a grown-up, New Yorklike, somehow Christmassy atmosphere that felt at odds with who Ella Fitzgerald was. She herself surely hadnt inhabited such spaces, at least not until she became a famous singer. That meant, too, that the prison that she was always singing about, in that elegant delighted tone, between the devil and the deep blue seashe wasnt in it, and hadnt been in it, she had been in a different one, and so you were alone in an experience that she couldnt be having, simply by virtue of the shimmering, silvery voice that could not but have utterly transformed the life of any person who sang like that. Surveying the room, I was surprised to see ahin from the Turkish students club, standing near the window, talking to a fair-haired guy. Oh, so I actually know a literature person, ahin said, when I went over. This isnt really my scene. He had to lean over for me to hear him. I had never stood so close to him before, and hadnt realized how tall he was. His friend was also well over six feet. It was pleasant to stand beside them, to feel like the smallest and most delicate person. They were drinking to ahin getting a grant to study Antarctic seabirds. He had to hurry because the winter here was the summer there. They made some joke I didnt hear, repeating the word icepick. I dont know that Ive ever seen an icepick, I said, producing much mirth. ahin brought me a glass of wine. We drank to some kind of petrel. So what else is new with birds? I asked. ahin explained that someone in China had identified an unknown bird and named it after Confucius. Someone else had discovered that dinosaurs had had feathers. This was true, not just of avian dinosaurs, but of some other dinosaurs. That reminded me of a Woody Allen line, about how the thing with feathers turned out not to be Hope, but was actually his, Woody Allens, nephew. I didnt have positive feelings about Woody Allen, whose movies so often included scenes of men my parents age having remedial conversations about free will, or dating catatonic-seeming teenagers. Yet I now found it humorous that his nephew, like both the avian and non-avian dinosaurs, had feathers. Was it the wine that helped a person appreciate things uncritically? Was that why Ivan had always been trying to get me to drink? Definitely, it was easier to think of things to say. In the past, my goal in conversation had been to accurately represent the things that I thought, and to deploy these thoughts in relation to the things that other people said, while exercising caution to not betray ignorant or antisocial ideas, and the whole thing had been so much to think about that in the end I usually hadnt said anything at all. Svetlana had pointed out that, if I actually listened to other people, instead of worrying so much about what I was going to say, I would notice that everyone was saying all kinds of antisocial, ignorant, or irrelevant things, which were often just a posture they were trying out, as opposed to a reflection of their essential personality, which was probably a thing that didnt even exist. I hadnt believed her, but she was right: nobody was actually answering anything anyone else had said, and people were constantly betraying antisocial ideas. ahins friend brought me another glass of wine. How easy and pleasant it was to stand there with them, saying whatever random, irrelevant stuff came to mind. The two guys looked amused, and occasionally contributed their own random, irrelevant observationsthough their general attitude was one of being impressed that I could think of so many more of them. It was implicit that it was girls role to think of such things, and their role to view them as amusing. I felt that I understood for the first time, because I was able to participate in it, the persona inhabited by Priya and the beautiful nonsmoker. It turned out that I could ask the guys whatever questions I thought of, and they would answer. I asked ahins friend where his accent was from, and he said Poland. I asked about the public transportation system in Warsaw: whether it was on the honor system to buy a ticket, whether there were inspectors like in Budapest, whether he had ever run away, or talked himself out of a fine. He smiled evasively and said that it was possible that something like that might have happened. He said you could ride a tram for free if you had fought in the Warsaw Uprising, or if your mother had given birth to you on another tram. Later we were at another party in a dorm. Why did all parties sound and smell the same, even though the component people were different? It was as if all the different individuals came together and formed the eternal entity Party Person. This reminded me of Voltron, a cartoon about five space pilots who were supposed to defend the universe. In every episode, they got into a terrible predicament, where the one who was a girl was always about to have to become a sex slave and carry fruit on her head. At the last minute, they would remember to merge their five rockets, thereby forming Voltron: a gigantic unbeatable robot-man with rocket-arms and rocket-legs. It was unclear why they didnt become Voltron earlier. Its probably their selfish American individualism, ahin said. I was impressed by this evidence that he had been following my long story about Voltron. On the other hand, I was pretty sure Voltron hadnt been an American show. Then againmaybe that was why their selfish individualism didnt work better. I asked whether there was anything in a gin and tonic besides gin and tonic. ahins friend said that the beauty of a gin and tonic lay precisely in its simplicity. The conversation turned to quinine. ahin said that birds could get malaria; it happened to native Hawaiian songbirds. So get a grant to go to Hawaii and make them tiny gin and tonics, ahins friend said, handing out another round. I watched the people moving around the room in different configurations. What were they even doing? Not exactly dancing, or talking. They were partying. People talked about it as if it was an honorable, prestigious activity. Massive Attack was playing at a loud volume. I felt like there was something behind all the people that I could almost make outsomething moving. I could almost see Voltron in the background, raising his giant arm. Tea lights perched on the rim of a claw-footed bathtub. The sink had two faucets. One tap ran scaldingly hot; the other, numbingly cold. The bathroom door opened, and ahins friend came in. I felt embarrassed to realize I hadnt locked the door. I said I was just leaving. I turned off the cold faucet; the other was now too hot to touch. But ahins friend walked right up to me, looked down at my face with a speculative, almost affectionate expression, and kissed me. It felt slow and easy and endless and immediate. For something that had seemed so impossible for so long to happen so effortlessly, like a row of cards falling over, and falling, and falling... I remembered some advice I had read in Seventeen magazine, when I had pneumonia and my mother had therefore gotten me Seventeen magazine, about what to do with your hands When He Kissed You. It said to put one hand on his neck and the other on his chest. The hand on the chest let you feel how strong and sexy he was, but also gave you control. I put my hand on his chest, to feel how strong and sexy he wassomehow unexpectedly solid, like a statue, though also, of course, alive. He smelled faintly and intoxicatingly of aftershave, and of sweat, which didnt make sense, because the smell of sweat was usually repulsive. With my other hand, barely daring to touch the back of his neck, I felt the place where his buzz cut started. It felt so tender and dear and aliveso full of life. What an amazing thing a neck was, the way all the blood in a human body had to pass through it, and how easy that made it to kill someone, and this easiness of killing a man also felt dear and close to my heart. He put his hands on my waist, moving them over the soft fabric of my skirt, and slid one hand under the waistbandfirst over my underwear, then under it. When I felt his hand on my skin, I felt a wave of panic and pushed lightly with my hand on his chest. Right away, he took his hand out of my underwearjust like Seventeen magazine had implied that he would. How amazing that it was possible to communicate like that. He touched my face, tilted my chin up, and the angle changed and got deeper. My own hair felt silky against my neck. He stepped back and looked down at me again. There was something new in his expression, something lazy and proprietary. We went back outside and stood in a circle with ahin and some other people, dancing. This lasted a long time. ahins friend danced for a while with a short girl who was wearing a silver dress. Then somehow he and I were facing each other, there were no people between us, and then he was standing closer and brushed his hand against my leg, and touched my waist, and kissed me again. Shall we get out of here? he said in a suave, euphemistic-sounding tone. I nodded. I always wanted to get out of here, and nobody ever asked. I didnt understand where we would go, or whether ahin would come, and, if not, what we would tell him. Get your coat, he said. I was looking through the enormous pile of coats when I became aware of ahin standing next to me. Whats new, he said in Turkish. Everythings good, I replied, pulling out a coat and trying to figure out if it was mine. You dont have to jump, he said. To jump? I repeated. He nodded emphatically. You dont have to jump. Im here. I didnt understand what he was saying. His friend came back, took my coat out of my hands, and helped me put it on. The cold was breathtaking. ahins friend and I were walking toward the river. Our hands brushed against each other, and then he took my hand in his, which felt warm and smooth. Why wasnt it possible to hold hands all the time? I suddenly remembered that, in grade school, Leora and I would routinely walk down the hallway holding hands. When had that stopped seeming normal? It felt wonderful to walk next to someone so tall and strong. As soon as I had the thought, I remembered that that was what my mother said about walking next to me, and it always made me feel stressed-out. What if I made this guy feel that way? I looked at him. He didnt seem especially stressed-out. Maybe it was OK, since I wasnt his mother. I didnt understand why he was slowing down in front of some random iron gate. Heres where I live, he murmured. It hadnt occurred to me that we were going to where he lived. We went through the gate, under a clock tower, across a courtyard, into a brick entryway, up several flights of steps. In one deft movement, he unlocked and opened the door and flicked on a sallow overhead light. When he leaned in to kiss me, it was like sliding back into the water on one of those long days at the beach, where you just get out so you can go back in again. At some point, he said he would be right back, and disappeared into the bathroom. I remained standing, contemplating a pile of outdoor equipment that was leaning against the wall. When I had looked at it for a whileit had spikesI walked around the room, which was minimally furnished with a sofa and a coffee table. The sofa, when one sat on it, had an organic, swamplike quality. There was a journal lying on the coffee table. I opened it to a random page. Depolarization-induced slowing of Ca2+ channel deactivation in squid neurons. It seemed to be a sign about how big the world washow full of unknown processes. ahins friend came out of the bathroom, went over to where we had been standing, and seemed surprised that I wasnt there. His eyes swept the room without seeing me. Maybe I had sunk too far into the sofa. In his bemused yet tolerant expression, I felt like I could see his whole attitude toward girls. They could be anywhere! He actually opened the closet and looked inside, like maybe I would be sitting in there thinking about my period. Over here, I said. He seemed slightly annoyed, like it was unfair of me to expect him to guess that I would do something like sit on the sofa. This despite the hallowed traditional nature of sofa-sitting. But maybe I had imagined it, because then he was saying, again in the suave voice: I was afraid I had lost you. We started kissing again. How smooth, how easy it felt. Suddenly, I started worrying that it was too easy, that I was being too passive and was failing to be interesting or express my personality. Magazines always said stuff like that: Dont just lie there. I tried to think of different things I could do. There didnt seem to be that many things. He started to laugh. Maybe go a little easy with the tongue, he said. I felt encouraged: so you could request pointers. Does a person have to be interesting? I asked. He didnt answer. Just relax, he said finally. I never had liked being told to relax. In his bedroom, the bottom bunk had been removed to make a loft, but there was no desk or dresser underneathjust empty space. With nothing there to step on, it was unclear how to get into the top bunk. I like this fabric, he said, fingering it for a moment before pulling my top over my head: something I hadnt experienced since age six. How strange that this was like thatthat the most adult thing was in some way like being a child. When he tossed the garment onto the floor, I resisted the urge to pick it up and fold it. I felt a pang of regret and embarrassment that this was all happening with these clothes that were a gift from my aunt. She had been happy to get them for me because they were appealing and attractive... and thus, in some sense made for a guy to be taking them off and dropping them on the floor? It was my uncle who had a job and made money, and gave it to my aunt. You need to stop thinking about this. ahins friend reached behind my back to undo my bra. It opens from the front, I said, just as he undid the brafrom the back. He found the hidden zipper and the skirt fell to the ground with a soft whoosh. I stepped out of it and hastily picked it up and draped it on a chair. His shirt had disappeared. How were his arms and chest so strong? I reached a clearer understanding of why a mans body was exciting: not just in itself, but because of how it made you feel, how slender and pliant. It turned out that the way you got into the bed was by climbing on top of the desk and sort of jumping. Why would a person choose to live this way? His pillowcase was black with a white skull. The sound of his belt buckle caused something to happen between my legs. How did my legs know? I thought about the walls have ears, and then the legs have ears, and about how it was supposed to be sexual when Shakespeare talked about pouring poison into an ear. Is something funny? he murmured. I started to explain, but he didnt seem that interested. How radical to feel so much of a persons skinnot with ones hand but with ones body. I had never seen eyes that color up close: grayish blue with hazel flecks. He put his hand between my legs, pushing aside my underwear. This time, I let him. Ah, Jesus. His voice had some kind of regret in it, like something was somehow going to get him in trouble. The feeling of being able to get him in trouble was breathtaking. I was trying to run through the possibilities at the same rate as external developments. I knew that the first time you had sex was supposed to be with someone special who cared about you. I also knew that, even if it wasnt your first time having sex in your whole life, you werent supposed to do it with any particular person on a first date. Since I had never had sex before, and hadnt been on even one date with this guy, indications were I should not let him have sex with me, if that was what he was trying to do, on this, our zero date. On the other hand, Svetlana had done everything the way you were supposed to, and none of it had sounded appealing. Even Svetlana herself hadnt seemed that enthused about it. Furthermore, supposing I did want to follow that routewho knew whether or when the opportunity would arise? Special, caring guys, the kind who were always talking about respecting women, never did seem interested in me. Frankly, I wasnt their number-one fan, either. The more I thought about it, the less I understood why the duration of my current conditionthis indignity and stuckness, the feeling of being somehow tied to Ivanshould depend on my ability to find some doofus who would tell me I was special. I already knew I was special. So what did I need the doofus for? Insofar as this guy, whose hand was now completely inside my underwear, touching me in a way that was contiguous with, yet different frommore agitating, more erratic thanthe way I touched myself, I had lost my train of thought. Where was I? OK: insofar as he didnt seem to think I was special, and seemed to be engaging with me only as a girl, as a woman, as a member of the category he pursued because of what he wasit felt euphoric and freeing, it was one of the most exciting things that had ever happened to me. Then he moved his hand farther back and did something that made me freeze with pain and terror, and I realized that, as often happened, all my thinking had been beside the point. I couldnt decide to go further, any more than you could decide to bend your elbow in the opposite direction. Im not very experienced, I blurted. Thats fine, he said, and withdrew his hand. It was weird how some things you said seemed to have no meaning to him, while others had a recognized meaning that he immediately responded to. Ill show you what you can do, he said in the suave voice. So, here was the thing everyone kept talking about: his desire, that was tangible and real. Was it really in some way about me? He put his hand around mine. I had often heard the term hand job. This was clearly it. And here was another thing I had heard about: the gap between the signifier and signified. Where the term hand job sounded generic, mechanical, and tough, the act itself felt specific, organic, tender, and sort of gross. The skin was so soft and mobile. An eyeless creature was going in and out of its cowl. I couldnt imagine putting it in my bodyhow it would fit, or what the point would be. He released my hand, so I could do it by myself, but it turned out I wasnt doing it right. He demonstrated: more vigorous, more rhythmic, harder, slower. At first, I wanted to do a good job, but I soon grew demoralized. It felt like I was missing too much information. Couldnt he do a better job himself? What was the point of delegating it to someone who would do a worse job? A twinge of pain shot through my palm. What if I got repetitive strain injury again, like with the gardening catalog? As I was wondering how to diplomatically phrase my concerns, the thing happened that I had often seen symbolized in movies by geysers or fountains or a lawn irrigation system. But this was such a helpless little spurt, it seemed so young, like a new spring plant. I couldnt help feeling touched. He pulled a Kleenex from a box wedged between the bed frame and the wall. Kleenex, not toilet paper: a class act, I thought, because part of me was always generating a commentary. I was worried that I was going to have to try to sleep here, in the narrow bunk with the single, sinister pillow, but it became clear that this wasnt expected. He helped me pick up my clothes, watched me get dressed, kissed me, touched my waist again. I was sorry when he removed his hand and stopped kissing me. Why did everyones favorite part have to be something different? I woke up early and went running. It was the first day all year that made it possible to imagine what spring would be like. Sunlight sparkled off the river. Crew boats sliced through the current like long stick-insects. Everything looked new and freshly painted. The old paint jobs looked freshly chipped. It was only afterward, when I had taken a shower and was getting dressed, that a great column of malaise crashed over my head, causing me to understand that it was not possible to outrun a hangover. When I woke up again several hours later, my headache was gone, though it also felt like I had died and nothing was real. The weather was the same, but more so. On my way to the libraryI didnt know where else to goI ran into Gavriil, who suggested taking a walk. We walked around for two hours, soaking in the balmy sunlight. I hadnt planned to say anything about the previous night, but he talked so much about Katie that I ended up telling him I had met a guy and gone home with him. How old was he? Gavriil asked. I could answer that, because he had mentioned his birthday. Twenty-three, I said. Gavriil said the whole thing sounded sketchy. He looked into my eyes and held my hand and said he thought I should be with someone who really cared about me. At dinner, Riley asked if I was seeing someone. No, I said. She frowned slightly. Adam mentioned that he saw you with someone at a party. Thats true, but I just met him at the party, I said, trying to remember who Adam was. Is he friends with Adam? Adam doesnt know him well, but he said he thinks hes a really nice guy. Hes older, right? I recognized in Riley the same curiosity I had always seen in my aunts, about whom I was going to date. In line at the dishwashing window, a guy was describing his recruitment interview with McKinsey. They didnt ask you about facts, but invited you to solve puzzles. The puzzles were about the mysteries of mass production: how M&Mswere made, how toothpaste got into tubes. They want to see how you think, he said, in a venomous tone. After dinner, I still felt like walking. I set out along the river toward MIT, listening to the Tom Waits tape that had the song Innocent When You Dream on it. The bellowing sentimentality made me laugh, yet I still felt moved. The longing of someone who was no longer innocent, for the time when he had been innocentthe idea of getting a reprieve, in dreams, from non-innocence, or from any other aspect of the presentmade me think I was going to cry, although I never actually cried anymore. It felt like my eyes had physically dried up. Previously, I had believed that the sadness came first, and tears were a result, but the reality was clearly more complicated, because once the tears didnt come, the sadness somehow bottomed out, became shallower. What if the way Zoloft worked was just by dehydrating you? Hulking buildings flanked the river. Some were dark and warehouse-like, others brilliantly lit. The moon had risen, and planes and satellites blinked inscrutably. I felt it was the time for stocktaking: for looking back at what I had learned about the aesthetic life. In its simplest form, the aesthetic life involved seducing and abandoning young girls and making them go crazy. This was what I had learned from books. There was a problem of application: what did you do if you were a young girl? Nadja had been a girl, and had tried to live an aesthetic life. That had involved her being seduced and abandoned and going crazy. But that had been then. What were you supposed to do now: seduce and abandon men? Was that what feminism had made possible? Something about the idea didnt feel aesthetic. Just think of the angry, complaining men. Maybe you, too, were supposed to be seducing and abandoning young girls: was that what feminism had made possible? But what would you do with the young girls? And wouldnt it put you in a losing competition against men? Maybe it was OK to just ruin men more broadly: not the way men ruined girls, by driving them out of society into convents or mental institutions, but, rather, by getting them to pay for things, as had happened even in the days of Kierkegaard. I saw no percentage in driving another human being into a mental institution; but with money, a person could travel, or write books. A person could live an aesthetic life. Where did you draw the line between trying to make a particular person fall in love with you and give you money, and trying to get money out of the world more generally? The next song on the Tom Waits album was called Ill Be Gone. In the verses, Tom Waits was enumerating different things he was going to do tonight: cut the hearts from pharaohs, drink a thousand shipwrecks, paint a sheet across his bed. The chorus was: And in the morning Ill be gone. A rooster crowed. It made me think of the line in The Seducers Diary, where the seducer was up late, plotting Cordelias ruin, thinking about how sad it all was, and a cock crowed, and he said that maybe Cordelia heard it, toobut she would think it was the coming of a new day. Tom Waits had gotten more and more worked up, and was now just shouting random-sounding phrases: Eight hundred pounds of nitro! I have a French companion! Ill Be Gone seemed in some way like an antidote to the feeling summed up by the new Cranberries single, When Youre Gone: its syrupy fifties doo-wop harmonies reproducing, again and again, the dreamy, layered awfulness of everything without you. How could I work it so that I would be gone? Some key seemed to reside in the phrase leaving the country. Im leaving the country. Ill have to leave the country. Hadnt international travel been, in some sense, the yardstick that Ivan used to measure human wortheven though, in most other ways, he had seemed to look down on rich people? Later, in Hungary, other people had asked the same questionWhat other countries have you been to?in the same tone; implying that leaving the country wasnt a sign of privilege, but a kind of accomplishment. What was the relationship between leaving the country and an aesthetic life? What was it about America in particular that seemed to make ones life unaesthetic? Did it just seem that way to me? Didnt everyone in the world think that American people were babies? For most of my childhood, I was the only child in the American chapter of my family, and the only American person in any part of my family, and there had been no very clear distinction between my Americanness and my childishness: the way my parents had to carry my peanut butter and Flintstones vitamins in a suitcase, and other children had to be warned not to make fun of me for not knowing about things. (My cousin Evren still complained about that: how I had cried about everything, and she had been blamed.) Wasnt that how people in other countries viewed all American peoplewith their innocence, their Disney, their inability to drive stick shift? With the way they were protectedthe way I was protectedfrom so much of the reality that happened elsewhere? I had previously been looking down on the people who were already panicked about the summer, frantically applying to work at Merrill Lynch or to build houses in Tanzania. I now realized that I had been wrong: I had to start panicking, too. Somehow, I had to get someone to pay for me to leave the country. What was the relationship between leaving the country, ruining people, falling in love, and having sex? There clearly was one. It was starting to occur to me that, when it came to having sex, I had mistaken an emergency measure for a sustainable policy. But the emergency had been childhood itself, and sex was the thing that made you not a child. It was the thing that made your childhood finally end. I had thought that an aesthetic life would be more like a string of adventures than like a coming-of-age novel, or the life-cycle of a frog, where there was a grand progression ending with maturity and the ability to procreate. But it was impossible to imagine an aesthetic life, or any life, without falling in love. Without love, knowledge itself became a hassle; became bullying and imposition. My country. Learn about my country. Being in love was the only thing that made you want to learn about a persons country, or about anything else outside your experience. Falling in love was the essential feature of a novel. The Russian word for novel, roman, could also mean love affair. A love affair implied sex, at least the question of sex. What was the relationship between falling in love and having sex? Even in middle school, I had known that it was related to being in love that my underwear would get wet, that I had dreams about being pregnant, that I wanted to look up orgasm in a dictionary. But I hadnt thought any further than that. It had never been the most pressing problemespecially since nobody had shown any signs of wanting to have sex with me. Now, multiple variables had changed. First, the emergency was over and I didnt have to be a child anymore. It was time to become a writer, and understand the human condition. Second, hadnt that guy, ahins friend, who had been, in retrospect, handsomehadnt he wanted to have sex with me? I went over the whole interaction again in my mind, and couldnt think of any other interpretation. If falling in love was the only way to learn anything, and if falling in love was in some way about sex, could the fact that I hadnt had sex explain why I seemed to myself not to have really learned anythingwhy I seemed not to have really learned anything about, for example, Hungarywhy everything I did learn felt somehow incomplete and beside the point? Was it sexhaving sexthat would restore to me the sense of my life as a story? Should I have done it with that guy, when the opportunity presented itself? Should I do it now? How would I go about it? Would he still want to? Inconveniently, I seemed not to have retained his name. ahin had introduced us, but we both had foreign names, the kind you needed to hear a couple of times. It began to seem inauspicious that he hadnt asked me to repeat my name. On the other hand, maybe he had missed the right moment, and had planned to ask ahin later. Once this possibility occurred to me, I felt sure that it was going to happen: he would find out my name, and contact me in some way. March The most well-established way to get someone to pay for you to go overseas was to be a researcher-writer for Lets Go. Every year, they sent like a hundred people around the world, to update the previous years guidebook. On my application, I put Russia as my first choice, followed by Argentina and Spain. Meanwhile, at the student employment office, I found a summer job posting from a Peruvian frozen food manufacturer who was starting a partnership with a Moscow supermarket chain, and wanted to hire an English speaker who also knew either Russian or Spanish. It was unclear what the job entailed, but I felt excited to apply, because I had studied both Russian and Spanish. Radcliffe College turned out to give special travel grants for women. At first, it seemed unfair to try to gain a financial advantage from being a woman, when things were so much easier for me than they had been for my mother and aunts. On the other hand, it was becoming increasingly clear that literally nothing was fair. The people who had said that throughout ones childhood hadnt just been joking around, or trying to whitewash their own personal lack of integrity. So, I went ahead and applied for a grant in the amount of the tuition for an accredited summer study program in St. Petersburg. I hadnt heard anything from ahins friend, so I decided to ask ahin what his name was. ahin somehow didnt seem thrilled, but he told me. The name, Przemysaw, was one I didnt know how to pronounce. One of the Iris Murdoch novels that my mother and I liked had a character in it whom everyone called the Count, not because he was a count, but because he had a Polish name that none of the English people could say. Thats a dogs breakfast of a name, one of his schoolteachers told him kindly. I remembered dogs breakfast and kindly, and another line that said: By now it had fully dawned upon the Count how irredeemably Polish he was doomed to be. Was that a problem Przemysaw had? There were only two Przemysaws in the whole university database, and one of them was in the dental school. I carefully composed an email to the other Przemysaw, asking if he wanted to get a coffee. He wrote back right away. To be honest, I dont really drink coffee. It turned out there was always a party somewhere. You could go to one every night if you wanted. You didnt have to know the people who lived there. At one party I ran into Ham, a guy who had been in the Constructed Worlds class last year. His hair was longer now, and green. I could tell from how he hugged me that I could go home with him if I wanted to. I walked around the room, drinking warm beer from a Solo cup. Everyone was obsessively drinking this beer, which came out of a keg. I had never seen a keg before. It looked comically literal. I went back to where Ham was standing and stood close to him. Sure enough, within two minutes, he put his arm around me and asked if I wanted to leave. Had it always been this easy, and I just hadnt noticed? Armies of tiny painted lead figures, belonging to different tribes or races, were stationed on every surface of his dorm room. The drawers of the dresser were pulled out to varying extents and covered with green felt, so they made terraces, and there was a war happening on the terrace. Clearing a platoon of militarized trolls from the bed, Ham talked about his girlfriend in Anchorage, who had an eating disorder. He said he had always been attracted to me in Constructed Worlds, a class that had literally no normal people in it. I told him I had never had sex before. He said there were lots of other things we could do. So I didnt technically have sex with him, either. He had a huge cock, terrifying, curved upward, like a horn. At another party, I drank two rum and Cokes and became violently ill. I hadnt thrown up since childhood. It was even worse than I remembered. The host, a guy I barely knew, seemed really worried, and left his own party to walk me home. I didnt think you would even come, he kept saying. I woke up the next day feeling sicker than I could remember having felt in my entire life. I dragged myself to brunch and barely recognized Juho when he sat across from me. I hope I am not being rude, but you look terrible, he said. His eyes were alight with the informativeness of someone who had clearly had a lot of hangovers in his life, and held a Ph.D. in chemistry. I told him what had happened, and asked how it was possible to feel like this after only two drinks, when I had drunk more than that in the past without getting sick. Juho explained that there was a lot that we didnt understand about how alcohol worked on the brain, but that different people were affected differently by the compounds that accompanied the production of ethanol, which, in turn, could interact differently with carbonation, sugar, and caffeine. Dark liquors like rum had more compounds than vodka, because they werent distilled so many times, and cheap rum was distilled less than expensive rum. In the end, there were so many factors that you would probably never know why you got sick one time and not another, but a good idea was to drink lots of water and avoid cheap booze. Interestingly, the effects of a hangover seem to be the same as mild alcohol withdrawal, so you feel better if you drink more. I do have some vodka in my room, Juho said. Oh my God, no. Juho told me about how some people in Iceland treated hangovers by eating specially putrefied shark meat that had been buried for a long time in sand. OK, I never want to talk or think about this ever again, but how long do they bury it? Well, a few months, I think. We had adopted, in our conversation, the universally humorous attitude toward alcoholtoward people throwing up, and blacking out, and being hung over. And yet... it felt like you were dying. Of course, you werent really dying. Was that the source of the humor: the disjuncture between how serious it felt and how trivial it really was? I remembered now that, in the fall, a guy at MIT had died of alcohol poisoning while pledging a fraternity. At the time, I had dismissed this as a story about a guy who was so dumb that he drank until he died. Now, it looked different. After all, I had been dumb enough to drink until I threw up. That was because it had come up on me by surprise. So maybe that frat guy had been surprised. More broadly, why was it considered laudable, sociable, and funny to do this thing that often made a person feel like they were dying, and occasionally actually did induce death? Of course, you couldnt have a party without alcohol; I understood this now. I understood the reason. The reason was that people were intolerable. But wasnt there any way around that? Juho was talking about different research into alcoholism that people were doing in Finland. Why was nobody researching the more direct issue of how to make people less intolerable? It might be a case of having to reduce a big problem we cant solve to a smaller problem that we can solve, Juho said. One Sunday afternoon, Oak and I went to the film archive to see a restored print of Ivan the Terrible. Afterward, we walked around the arts building. When the cleaning crew had left, we went back into the dark screening room and sat on the floorit was interesting to see the screen from such a different angletalking in a desultory way about beards. At some point, I wondered if Oak was going to kiss me, and he did. He wasnt someone I had just met, and we hadnt been drinking. Was that why it felt somehow more cognitively demanding than usual? Was this something rational? Was he going to be my boyfriend now? He started to unbutton my jeans, but I said, truthfully, that I had my period, and shortly thereafter we dusted ourselves off and went to dinner with Riley and the others. When we were all saying goodbye, I stayed behind a moment next to Oak, and he briefly held my hand, but otherwise nothing was different from usual. At another party, I encountered a guy who combined such a grotesque gnawing, prying way of kissing, with such a tedious, smirking, and knowing attitude, that I couldnt go through with it. The guy had the same accent as Lakshmi, whom he was talking about in a presumptuous and avuncular way. The party was at a distant residence, so then I had to stand fifteen minutes in the freezing cold at a shuttle stop, feigning grave illness and trying to prevent the guy from gnawing on my neck. In the past, when I had heard girls talk about different guys being good or bad at kissing, I had assumed, without consciously disbelieving them, that they had somehow been exaggerating: conflating whatever good or bad feelings they had about a guy with his imagined technique. Kissing had just seemed like a thing a person couldnt be especially good or bad at. I saw now how mistaken I had been. All the next week, I kept running into the gnawing guy. He kept smirking at me from corners and making insinuating remarks. I emailed the Count again. OK, forget the coffee, I wrote. Theres this other thing I need you to help me out with. I tried to explain it really clearly, so he wouldnt misunderstand, because I wasnt sure how good a reader he was. After I hit Ctrl-S, I started doing my Russian homework. I had done three exercises when the phone started to ring. His voice was deeper than I remembered. It was exciting to hear him slightly mispronounce my name. Selin was on the phone with a boy, Riley said, after I had hung up. I forced a smile. How had she known? The whole conversation had lasted like a minute. It must have been the tone of my voice. The next three days were among the most peaceful I had ever experienced. I didnt think about what was going to happen. It was settled, so I could finally stop thinking about it. On the evening of the third day, I went running, took a shower, and stared at my half of the closet. Did a person get dressed up? In the end, I put on jeans and the burnt-orange corduroy shirt from the Garment District. As I was about to leave, I realized I had misplaced my keys. I looked for ten minutes before finding them in the most obvious place: under Stanley. When I picked him up, he actually turned and looked at me. His yellow eyes with the black almond-shaped pupils: what was behind them? He turned away to stare at the wall. The clocks had just been turned forward. It was five past seven. The branches stood stark and bare against the glowing sky, but here and there the streetlights picked out the tiniest buds starting to show. It had rained earlier, and the pavement still sounded wet when a car drove by. I could smell everything: the rain, the asphalt, the tires, the damp soil, the tree bark, the barely visible new leaves. To see lifeto see what it really was. At first I was reflexively hurrying, because I was late. But then I thought better of it. He wasnt going anywhere. I should take my time, see as much as I could before the window closed again. I was really surprised when I got your email, said the Count. Nobody ever wrote anything like that to me before. No? I glanced around the room. He was looking at me in an amused, ironic way. I think we can both keep a secret, he said, in a suggestive tone. What did that mean? I wasnt allowed to tell anyone? Mm, I said, noncommittally. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a three-pack of condoms and a partially flattened tube of K-Y jelly. What had it been used for? When had it been acquired? How had the jelly gotten into the tube? I thought about the huge factories and the giant machines and the millions of dollars, the molds that shaped and crimped the molten plastic, the hiring of engineers and consultants, the deployment of some of those consultants to college cafeterias, to ask people how different colloidal substances got into tubesbecause they wanted to see the way you think. You dont have anything to drink, do you? I said aloud. You mean alcohol? No, sorry. Are you nervous? A mocking note had entered his voice. That felt deadly. I had to do something to change it. Willing myself to look into his eyes, I picked up his handit felt like the most forward thing I had ever doneand placed it on my chest, on what I thought was my heart, though I felt momentarily confused about left and right. But did it matter, wasnt my whole rib cage pounding? It worked. He was serious again. We dont have to do anything you dont want to do, he said. I know, I said. He moved his hand farther down. Well take it very slowly. And then it was like slipping back into the water again after lying on hot sand, and knowing you were going to go back and forth like that, between the beach and the sea, until the sun burned up and sank into the water. I felt simultaneously calm and excited, in a way that felt somehow inhalableI wanted to inhale it. There was a brief jolt when he unbuttoned my jeanswasnt he being a bit overliteral?but, once I recovered, it wasnt unpleasant to be wearing fewer clothes. A series of expressions moved across his face. I knew that his feelings couldnt be the same as mine, but they seemed, at least in that moment, to be equally numerous. How close I felt to him, and I felt him feel it, too, and I thought: Would it have killed him to have coffee first? We went through the bizarre ordeal of climbing onto his bed. I understood the point of faking an orgasm. Clearly, he wasnt going to stop what he was doing until something changed. But it wasnt quite right, and I didnt know how to direct him. It was like hearing a sound in the forest and not knowing which way it was; and, even if I had known the direction, it would have taken too long to get thereit seemed to be taking longer, latelyand I would have worried that he was bored or uncomfortable, and even if I could have known that he wasnt bored or uncomfortable, I wouldnt have been able to bear such intensity and tension without knowing how and when and whether it was going to end. It was increasingly imperative for there to be some achieved or manufactured climaxnot just so that he would stop, but so that he would feel as masterful and gentle and adept as we both needed him to be, and so that I would feel as responsive and released and grateful as we needed me to beand I heard myself uttering sounds that I hadnt known I was capable of producing: the kind of soft cries that conveyed, in movies, that what was happening was simultaneously against a persons will or judgment, but was also what they most wanted. My breath caught in my throat, I experienced a convulsion that both was and was not my own doing. What even was fake? He half laughed, and moved his hand farther back. God, youre so wet. I didnt understand what he meant, until he showed me. Then I felt my heart also melt. He sat up and I heard the condom wrapper tear. I sat up, too, to see better. How was it all rolled up like that? How big was the machine that did that? How was he going to get it on? What did it feel like? You look fascinated, he said, with a hint of dissatisfaction. Why wouldnt I be? He didnt say anything, but once his hands were free again, and he was above me, I felt that his preferred state had been restored. The preferred state was for me not to be fascinated. It was for me not to be thinking about the condom factory, wondering why they called it Trojan when the Trojan horse was a story about permeability, about how the Greeks swarmed out and foiled the Trojans, who had believed themselves to be protectedand in the moment that he pushed me onto my back I realized, with elation, that I could prefer that state, too, that I didnt need to be thinking about those things. It was the opposite of they want to see the way you think. There was nothing to do but to look up at him, to reinforce our shared awareness of his greater strength. What good fortune, that the thing he wanted was something I was so eminently capable of wantingthat my desires overlapped, or could overlap, with the concrete social reality. I felt my body adjusting to the concrete social reality. Youre sure you want to do this? I nodded. I think I need you to say it. I want to. Unimaginable pain shot through my body. I cried out in a different way than I had before, and understood that this was truly involuntary and thus not-fakebecause it was an extension of how every fiber of my being was saying that this was something that was not supposed to be happening. Try to relax, he murmured. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. At first, I thought the relaxing was working. Then it really startedthe pain. I willed myself to relax into it. It intensified and grew until it was bigger than the tallest building, looming over and around me. Do you want me to stop? No. The thought of having to go through this again laterbecause we didnt do it right the first timewas unbearable. He applied more lube. I saw blood on the condom. That made me feel reassured. So something was finally happening. It went on happening. He told me again to relax. You have to let me, he said. I thought about letting him. It got so much more intense that I was sure it must be done, or almost done. This proved not to be the case. Im barely inside, he said. I detected a note of panic in his voice. Is there always this much blood? I asked. I dont know, he said tensely. What was it like your first time? Was she more experienced? You could say that, he said, in an ironic tone, implying that she had been a prostitute. He tried not to show that he was upset when blood got on his skull pillow. There was something exciting about the specificity of his reactionhow precisely it delineated what he was like: considerate enough to try to hide that he was upset, but not considerate enough to try harder, or to not be upset. Then he seemed to regain control of himself. That, too, was sexy: to see him conquer something, even himself. We might have to try something a little unorthodox, he said, in his suave, amused voice, helping me down from the bed. He pushed his computer to one side of his desk. Was he going to somehow use his computer? Then he laid me on my back on the desk, where the computer had been, and drew my legs up against his chest. My head kept hitting the window and I could see outside to the river, to Ivans old dorm. Walking down the damp street, I felt both wide awake and unprecedentedly still. For the first time I could remember, I didnt feel guilty about not working. It felt like I was finally off the clock. According to my watch, three hours had passed. My memory seemed to be missing some time. At some point, he had said something about his roommate, and asked if I wanted to take a shower. Taking stock of the situation, I realized there was nothing I needed so much as a shower. It was like a foreign country, nothing in there but an almost empty thing of Head & Shoulders, radically unlike the shower that I shared with three girls, where you were always having to make room for the rain-forest shaving gel between the custard-apple shampoo and the apricot exfoliant. The towel, too, was different. Coarse, gray, in no way objectively superior to our towelsto the contraryit nonetheless emanated a kind of protective strength that gave me a longing feeling. What would it be like if that was your towel? As a child, you learned that all the soft, colorful things were for girls, and at that time I had felt lucky. But this coarse gray towel... had I been duped? At some earlier point, he had gone to the bathroom, and I had been standing in front of the desk. I saw his pants with the heavy belt, the heavy fabric, everything heavier than my clothes, crumpled almost violently on the floor. I felt a desire to fold them, feeling like it was a good thing I could do for him, something that might even put us on more even terms. I had picked them up, shaken and smoothed them out, and was draping them over the back of the chair when he came back inand then I saw from his face that I had done something wrong, I wasnt supposed to fold his pants. Had it been before or after then that, surveying the scene of carnage, I had said, in my most sparkling voice, So this is what the big deal is about? No! He actually sounded worried that I thought that. I felt touched, though also disappointed that he didnt appreciate what I thought had been a really funny joke. It isnt usually like this, he said. Youll see later. Will I? I said. The words seemed to turn electric, like a battle line, live with the mortal danger that somehow surrounded the question of whether I would see him again. People said you had to be careful whom you lost your virginity to, because you would become attached, you would want to do it again, you would never get over it. Indeed, even though it had been one of the most painful experiences of my life, still what I felt toward him was something like gratitude, and a feeling of submission that was hard to differentiate from desirebecause you had to submit to something. I thought of a bus shelter ad I had once seen, for Virgin Atlantic (why was there a whole airline named after that?): you never forget your first time. They said you never forgot your first time, but they didnt say whether the other person forgot your first time. Mentally reviewing the way I had looked in the bathroom mirror, my face tearstained, my legs and body smeared with blood and K-Y jelly, I thought it was possible that he would remember. The dining hall soda dispensers were glowing in the dark. I drank a glass of Gatorade, followed by a glass of water. How had I gotten here? I made out a solitary figure in the dark, typing on a laptop. Was that Juho? Ah, I was hoping I would see you, Juho said, when I went over. I am always forgetting to give you this. After unzipping his giant backpack, he handed me something plastic and crinkly: a bag of the Finnish candy called Turkish peppers. These tarry black lozenges tasted powerfully of licorice and salt, and gave you a feeling of having inhaled swimming-pool water. I wasnt sure what was Turkish about them, or why they were considered desirable, yet I already wanted another one. We sat in the dark, sucking on the briny candies, talking about Juhos winter break. In the winter in Helsinki, the sun didnt rise until past nine, and set before four, so almost the whole time was twilight and darkness. You spent all day in this twinkling, glowing landscapebecause the electric lights reflected off the snowgoing between different cafs to listen to really specific kinds of music and drink incredibly strong coffee. Every home had its own sauna and, even though the national cuisine was based on hunting and fishing, it was still easier to be a vegan in Helsinki than it was at Harvard; a person wasnt always eating marinara sauce. Juho had never been away for so long, and understood now that he had been depressed. I told him that I had been depressed, too, but felt better after taking antidepressants. Juho said that he was glad I felt better, but that drugs werent the right solution for him, because in his case the depression was a natural reaction of his body to not procreating. I thought I hadnt heard him correctly. To not... procreating? Yes. As you know, we are genetically programmed to reproduce, and if we dont do what our bodies are programmed to do, we can expect to feel useless and sad. Once he finished his fellowship, he continued, he was planning to return to Finland and have children, so he wouldnt be depressed. I thought back to the many people I had seen in the course of life who had seemed more depressed after they had produced children. But what about postpartum depression? I asked. I think it is hormonal. Like feeling depressed after orgasm. It might be related to suddenly getting something you were deprived of. But it isnt a permanent condition. But being a parent... It was hard to put into words. How can you handle that much responsibility if youre already depressed? Well, youre assuming that a lack of responsibilities makes a person happy, and vice versa. I think this is a very American assumption. You have relatively few responsibilities now. Are you happy? Maybe you would feel happier if you had more responsibilities. The next morning, the angles of my face in the mirror looked differentmore sympathetic. I was still bleeding. The blood was bright red, not like during my period. But the amount didnt seem particularly worrisome, so I just put on a pantyliner and went to Russian. We were learning past participles. Grammatically, the emphasis was less on doing the thing than on having done it. Your hair looks nice today, Svetlana said. For the first time, I felt grateful for Matts presence at lunch, because I didnt have to think about whether to tell Svetlana about last night. I did keep thinking about it, on a loop in my head, but it actually made it easier to nominally participate in the conversation that Matt and Svetlana were having, which involved something somebody had said about stem cells. It went on like that all day: the previous night replaying over and over, seeming to confer a kind of weighted legitimacy onto all the routine, boring parts of the day, making me feel like I was in a movie. Why was it that, when you got to a routine or boring scene in a movie, you didnt panic or despair? In a movie, the number, duration, and meaning of scenes were determined in advance. You just had to wait it out. Theoretically, I supposed, this was true of real lifecertainly, the number and duration of scenes werent infinitebut there was always the chance it would just end without anything meaningful happening at all. Lakshmi was hosting another party, this one with a theme, and was worried that people wouldnt dress correctly. The theme was sadomasochism. You know, S&M, Lakshmi said. Bustiers, fishnets. Lakshmi had clearly lost her mind. I thought about not going, but this would have upset Lakshmi, and presented me with the problem of how to physically dispose of myself. The libraries would be closed or empty, because of the weekend. In my current condition, I was unable to work unless I was surrounded by other people who also appeared to be working. You dressed... somewhat appropriately! Lakshmi said, leaning in to kiss me on the cheek. I had put on Very Vamp lipstick and was wearing black lace tights with a floral pattern. Lakshmi seemed critical of the tights, until she saw they had seams on the back. Seams were apparently sadistic, or masochistic. Lakshmi was wearing a black leather choker with silver spikes, a fitted strappy top, a tiny vinyl skirt, and stiletto heels. Some people, like Lakshmi, looked cool or interesting in their sadomasochistic outfits, but most did not. One particularly tedious editor had a plastic ball strapped in his mouth, but kept taking it out to talk, so then he just had this saliva-covered ball hanging around his neck. A couple of first-year girls were wearing black lace bras with nothing on top, and looked sad and pauperlike. A literature major whom I knew slightly was walking her lame boyfriend around on a leash. The tough-talking heiress to a British grocery-chain fortune, who wrote microfiction where people made jokes about cancer, was wearing skintight leather pants that looked too expensive, and thus also somehow sad. I felt relieved to see Oak, who was wearing a black turtleneck and had what Svetlana called his demented Nureyev expression. His hair was sticking straight up and he seemed particularly distractible. At one point we were talking about Russian formalism, and then he had disappeared. I found him in the next room, playing with Lakshmis riding crop. Lakshmi rolled her eyes. Its not for you, she said. He looked at her boldly. Why not? Because youre not interesting enough or sufficiently good-looking, she said. A couple of bystanders laughed uncomfortably. Oaks eyes widened. Come on, I said, dragging him toward the stairs. Lets go have a cigarette. Why would she say that? Because all people do is reject and disappoint each other, I said. He shook his head vehemently. No, this is completely different. We stood in the window where people smoked cigarettes and I said things to try to cheer Oak up. Youre always very sweet, Oak said, playing with a pair of handcuffs that he had apparently had in his pocket. Are those real? I asked. The next thing I knew, Oak had handcuffed me to Jeremy, our most exhausting friend, who had come over to borrow a cigarette, and who was even now talking about how Michel Foucaults interest in bondage was related to his critique of penal institutions. Give me the key, I told Oak. I dont have it, he said. Before my eyes, he took a small key from his pocket, leaned over the window, dropped it out, and wandered off. I stared in disbelief. Had I done something to offend him? Well, I hope youre a masochist about stairs, because now were going downstairs, I told Jeremy, in an attempt to say something sadomasochism-themed that would cause us to go down the stairs. Lets have a drink first, OK? he said. Its been a long week. Key first, drink later, I said. Im going to get you some wine. Youre going to get me some wine? While I what: stand here and wait for you? We were both laughing by then, and had drifted over to where the wine was. Cheers, he said, pouring with one hand. Cheers, I conceded, feeling that it had been a long week. You know, he said, Ive always had a bit of a crush on you. The clear dishonesty filled me with outrage. What about the Dianes? I think Im finally over the Dianes, he said. Its a huge step for me. Tell me more, I said, taking advantage of his long answer to subtly drag us toward the stairs. Youre really not into me at all, are you, Jeremy said. Im sorry, I said. Its because youre in area studies. What? Theres always a fetish involved. You dont even want to look at me because Im not Eastern European. Although I felt confident that I would have found Jeremy exhausting no matter where he was from, it was nonetheless true that I had been only half listening to him, while thinking about Ivan and the Count, both of whom were Eastern European. This made me feel bad about myself. I forced myself to look at Jeremy. He had great hair and was wearing a cool T-shirt. On the other hand, he was one of the guys you sometimes met who held some kind of principled position against exercise, and this was manifest in his physique and comportment. Why didnt he feel like he constantly had to go running or starve himself, in order to earn the right to impinge on other peoples attention, the way Svetlana and I did? Now he was tracing a finger along the underside of my forearm. The skin over here is fine, but really just fair to middling. But here, close to the wristthis is sublime. I felt a stab of annoyance. Had I requested a comparative skin evaluation? I pointed out that the skin on the underside of his forearm, too, was smooth and soft. Thats the human arm, I said. You dont have to tell me. I have silky, girlish skin. Im not some huge Yugoslavian guy. I glanced around for somewhere to put out my cigarette. Thats the first thing Ive said that made you pay attention. You immediately looked around the room. Youre like Where is the huge Yugoslavian guy? Well, I accept that Im not some Yugoslavian stallion. I accept that I cant look at you from across the room with eyes that say, You know you vant to fuck me. Maybe youre the one looking for a huge Yugoslavian guy. Did it ever occur to you that your interest in me might be transferential? Even as I was saying it, I felt ashamed by the inadequacy and childishness of this, the first comeback I had thought of. But Jeremy was beaming rapturously. Touch! he said. What? Touch! You always speak ironically, and yet youre so sincere. You are the only one who can prevent me from my self-absorbed flights of bathos. Im a busy woman. I dont have time to prevent you from flights of bathos. I know! Youre just as self-absorbed as I am! Thats why were perfect for each other! Something powerful jolted through my body. At first I couldnt tell what had happened. Then I saw the Count standing in the doorway, wearing a shearling jacket. Our eyes met, and he raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly. Then there were people between us. When I caught sight of him again, he was heading right toward me. I felt my body changeeverything felt like it was melting and running down, like rain on a windowlike it was getting ready for something to be jammed in there againlike he owned me in some way. Hows it going, he said. Hey, I said. His eyes seemed to pass over Jeremy without seeing him. Are you here with someone? he asked, in a meaningful tone. This struck me as absurd. No, I said, equally absurdly. I saw him notice the handcuffs. Well, someone handcuffed us together, I said. His expression changedthat mockery entered into it. Looks like youre having a good time, he said, briefly gripping my shoulder, and disappeared again into the crowd. Who the fuck was that, Jeremy said. What do people ever do but torture each other? I asked Jeremy. For the first time, his eyes met mine, and it was as if some curtain had gone up and I was seeing him, the actual person, for the first time. I felt relief and promise, like maybe this was the beginning of our real relationship. But the curtain came down again almost immediately, everything went back to how it had been, and I understood that what had been revealed to me at this sadomasochism-themed party was the true face of all parties: how they were all, in one way or another, sadomasochism-themed. You do know that handcuffs all have a standard key, said a guy wearing a green open-fronted bodysuit. (Was that sadism, or was it masochism?) There isnt, he continued in an expostulatory tone, a different key for every pair of handcuffs. If that was true, then all we had to do was find someone else with handcuffs and ask for their key. I scanned the room and noticed two diminutive guys handcuffed to each other, wreathed in smiles. I dragged Jeremy over to them. They seemed eager to help. The one with sideburns produced a tiny key with one tooth. It fit perfectly. How could a key even be a key if they were all the same? Wasnt the point that each key was different? I tried to think it through, on the way to the bathroom. Was it related to whether your goal was to keep out many different people, or keep in one person? For a while, I had been dimly aware of something squishing under my right foot. In the privacy of a wooden stall, I realized that blood had soaked through the pantyliner, dripped down my leg and under the lace stockings, and pooled in my shoe. The bleeding stopped the next day. I felt relieved: if it had lasted any longer, I would have felt like I had to go to the student health center, which was always degrading. At the same time, I felt sorry and anxious, like I was back on the clock againlike some exemption was over. April Once, on an impulse, I picked up the phone and dialed the Counts number, but nobody answered. I left a message. A couple of days later, when I was walking back from dinner, I heard the whirring of a bicycle chain and someone said, Hey, Selin, and it was him. I was walking uphill and he was coasting down. He raised his hand cordially, but without slowing. One way of looking at it was that now I had feelings about another guy who wanted nothing to do with me. It was, of course, an outcome I had anticipated; but insofar as I had given it any thought, I had seen it as an improvement on the status quo, reasoning that it would feel more bearable and legitimate if the guy was someone Id actually had sex with. It had been a comfort to imagine a future in which I wasnt constantly thinking about Ivaneven if it meant just subbing him out for a guy with a worse personality. In fact I had been right: it did feel, by comparison, more bearable and legitimate. Yet to say that I was on any objective level enjoying myself would have been an overstatement. In creative writing, we read Chekhovs The Lady with the Little Dog. It was about a married man nearing forty, who had an affair at a summer resort with a married woman half his age. (So, she was my age.) She went everywhere with a little dog. After they had sex for the first time, she cried and said that she had fallen, and the Evil One had tempted her. Then, the man despised her and felt bored. In general, he looked down on women, and thought of them as the lower race, even though he always needed to have one of them around and was always having affairs with them and then forgetting about them. At the end of the summer, the man went back to Moscow. At first, he enjoyed wearing a fur coat and going to parties. But time passed, and he couldnt stop thinking about the lady with the little dog. That was how he thought of this person who was nineteen. Eventually, the man went to the crappy province where the lady lived, tracked her down to the depressing theater where she was attending an opening night, and realized that, despite her ordinary, even vulgar, clothes and accessories, she was, for him, the most important person in the world. When he cornered her during the intermission, she implored him to go away, and told him that she had never been happy, and never would be happy, but that she would come to him in Moscow. There was much I didnt understand in this story. Did the man like having an affair with the lady? If so, why didnt he think she was special? If she wasnt special, why was he unable to forget her? I also felt confused by his attitude toward his children. The part where he was walking his daughter to school, explaining weather formations, all the while thinking of how he wanted to go to a hotel and have sex with his girlfriend: that was something I felt that I had always known. But the part where it said, He was sick of his children, sick of the banklumping his children together with his jobthat was somehow shocking. In class, everyone talked about how subtle and understated Chekhov was, because he didnt idealize the characters, and made it clear that the protagonist was a cad. They discussed whether it was a redemption that he was able to feel love for a woman who was banal and wore a gray dress. I wondered whether I was having a defensive response to the story, because I hadnt acted the way the lady had when they had sex. I hadnt felt that the Evil One had tempted me, or that I had fallen. Nor was I holding my breath for the Count to be redeemed by realizing he couldnt live without me. Someone said that The Lady with the Little Dog broke all the rules of storytelling, because there was no climax or resolution. Leonard said that maybe that was what was so wonderful about Chekhov: how he was, in a wonderful way, boring. Was that true? Did I agree? Fundamentally, I liked Leonard. It didnt feel like he secretly hated us, or was trying to be mean. Yet almost everything he said caused me pain. Selin? Any thoughts? Leonard asked. I didnt know how to ask what I wanted to know: namely, what was wrong with Leonard, and what had been wrong with Chekhov, and why they seemed so unhappy, and made us unhappy, too. Instead, I talked about my favorite line in the story: the one where the guy realized that all parties were the same. You were always just stuck in a room while drunk people said the same things over and over, as if you were sitting in a madhouse or a prison. Thats such a great description of what unrequited love feels like, Leonard agreed. I had never heard anyone say the word unrequited, and hadnt realized it was pronounced that way, or that it was something Leonard had experienced. Or not necessarily unrequited, but just not going the way you want it to. Gazing into the distance, Leonard talked about a wrongness underlying the machinery, and everything he said was true. My mom forwarded me an email from Jerry. Can you explain to me the meaning of this missive? I hadnt realized that she and Jerry exchanged emails. I knew that he did sometimes call my mother, to complain that his wife, the shiksa ice queen, didnt know how to appreciate a good meal. Her ideal dinner was a bowl of cereal on the treadmill with The New England Journal of Medicine. Subject: Fw: Fw: Fw: Fw: Fw: Fw: More Evidence the World Is Full of Idiots * Police in Wichita, Kansas, arrested a 22-year-old man at an airport hotel after he tried to pass two counterfeit $16 bills. * A bus carrying five passengers was hit by a car in St. Louis, but by the time police arrived on the scene, fourteen pedestrians had boarded the bus and had begun to complain of whiplash injuries. * Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy machine. The message Hes lying was placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasnt telling the truth. Believing the lie detector was working, the suspect confessed.... I had gotten this email before. It had annoyed me with its self-congratulatory, pro-police tone. The thing with the photocopy machine sounded illegal. Its a joke email forward, losers send them. Ive gotten it like 4 times, I typed furiously. I dont know why he would send it to you. I guess to prove how cool he is. After I hit Ctrl-S, I realized I had managed to send the reply, not, as I had intended, to my mother, but to Jerry. My heart seized up. But why? What did I care whether Jerry knew that I thought he was a loser? Didnt he already know? The microwave at the Ukrainian Research Institute had started spontaneously turning on and microwaving invisible items. Katya said she had heard the microwave actually speaking Ukrainian. Reciting Shevchenko? Rob asked dubiously. Someone said it was possible for a microwave to pick up AM radio. Dear Ivan, I typed, when I was supposed to be working. Its hard to believe its already spring. There was a blizzard on April 1 so all the tulips fell down and diedor so we thought. April Fools, assholes! Now there are all these undead tulips all over the place. Ive been working really hard to do what you said, to move on and forget about you. It is necessary, and therefore possible. Im doing better than I was before, when I was so scared and upset. I didnt realize until afterwards how afraid I was! It was like there was something jamming the door, and I couldnt get out, and I was really starting to panic. In the end, I realized that one way to move it would be sex. I wrote an email to a guy I met at a party. Im not sure if this was, in itself, a good thing or a bad thing. Did you ever read in Russian formalism about the knights move? The theory is that change or innovation never goes in a straight line. Thats why its always surprising, and sometimes feels almost backwards. There is a wrongness underlying the machinery. The microwave is not supposed to recite Shevchenko! But where there is undeath, there is hope. Selin Malin and Elsa were visiting Boston. Elsa stayed one night with me, until Rileys glares, in combination with the bouquet of cat effluvia and sandalwood, drove her to Lakshmis. Its fine, dont worry about it, Lakshmi told me, barely even looking annoyed. She was busy planning a trip to New York with Isabelle and Noor, whose investment-banker friend, the owner of a SoHo loft, was vacationing in Monaco. I got called to an interview for Lets Go. So youre in second-year Russian, said the Russia editor. Do you think you know enough to bribe an official? I can learn it, I said. I mean, I already learned like seventeen lines from Eugene Onegin, so... I trailed off, confident in my reasoning that, whatever you had to say to bribe someone, it was surely less than seventeen lines. The mention of Eugene Onegin clearly left a negative impression on the editor. The greater part of this job is thinking on your feet, he said. Ill tell you what. Why dont you try to bribe me right now. Trying not to seem flustered, I removed the entire cash contents of my combination keychain-walletfour dollarsand waved them at the editors face. You want four dollars? I asked in Russian. OK, see, you cant wave money around like that, he said, adding that I had used the genitive plural for dollars, but four actually took genitive singular. That was when the Turkey editor, whom I hadnt noticed in the room at first, jumped into the conversation, asking a lot of questions about how well I spoke Turkish, what citizenship I held, where my parents were from, what other cities I had been to, and how much I knew about Central Anatolia. Not this again with the nervous breakdowns, I thought, because I knew Lets Go had a problem where they sent American people to Turkey and they kept having nervous breakdowns. The last guy had been beaten up by a pimp in Konya and fake-befriended by a reporter from Rolling Stone, who turned out to be gathering material for an expos. The editor started explaining about the nervous breakdowns. It turned out that I had been conflating two different guys: one who had a nervous breakdown in Konya, and another who had been befriended by a reporter in Istanbul and then had a nervous breakdown. A third American guy had gone to Central Anatolia last year, and had also had a nervous breakdown. The upshot was that Lets Go wasnt sending anyone to Central Anatolia who didnt speak Turkish, but I could go, if I wanted to. Joeys story in creative writing class was about a kid in high school losing his virginity, a phrase that sounded weird to me when used about boys. The narrator was lying on top of his girlfriend on an old sofa, and the girlfriend started to writhe and moan and cry out, and the narrator felt upset: he, too, wanted to writhe and scream, and felt it was unfair that only the girl was allowed to behave that way. I felt nonplussed. Could it be true that guys also wanted to moan and cry outto have their lack of control over the proceedings be an object of interest, and not of contempt? But just think if everyone was moaning and crying! And for him to begrudge his girlfriend... No, it couldnt be that all guys felt that way. Maybe it was just Joey. Was that why Lakshmi despised him? I went to an off-campus party with Riley and Priya, and the Count was there. I felt him trying to avoid mefrom one room to another. At first I thought I was imagining it, but it was definitely true. Also present was the guy who had loaned me his handcuff key at the S&M party. He had seemed nice at the time, but now he was speaking in an affected voice, repeatedly telling Riley and me to make out. If your mother language is your mother tongue, why isnt your mother country your mother cunt? some other guy was saying. All around us, people were ironically doing Jell-O shots. There was a giant abstract painting on the wall that I knew someone would eventually compare to a vagina. Riley and I had declined the Jell-O shots, so it became a project for some people to get us to do Jell-O shots. Lets just get it over with, I told her. She shrugged and we clicked together the tiny cups. Kiss! Kiss! chanted the handcuff guy. Riley kissed him on the cheek. The ironic people had clearly messed up the Jell-O, which hadnt gelled at all. Looking for the bathroom, I passed the Count, who was standing by the doorway next to a tall guy with puffy hair. That could be the clit, he was saying. They were looking at the painting that I had known someone would compare to a vagina. The next day at brunch, Priya was talking about how the Count had tried to hit on her. She didnt know he was the Count. That slutty guy with the impossible name, she said. He was hitting on the other two Southeast Asian girls, and then he came up to me and was like... Riley interrupted her, ostentatiously changing the subjectto be considerate of me. I realized that, although I hadnt felt implicated or hurt by Priyas characterization of the Count as a slutty guy who made unwelcome advances to women of Southeast Asian descent, I did feel hurt by Rileys assumption that I would or should feel implicated. It was just so gross, Priya said. The night I met him, the Count had been dancing up close with a short girl in a silver dress. Had she rejected him? Was he gross? On some level, I knew, it was a subjective evaluation. Yet the way Priya said it, in combination with Rileys response, made it seem objective. On the other hand, Priyas reality was different from mine. She had many more opportunities than I did, so of course she evaluated them differently. My life is ruined, Lakshmi said in a dead-sounding voice. It was Sunday afternoon. She should still have been in New York. It had started after lunch on Friday, when Isabelle had picked up Lakshmi in the BMW. Mia, the freshman who loved Finnegans Wake, had somehow already been in the back seat, pretending to be humble about impinging on their trip. They were picking Noor up next. Lakshmi understood that any seating configurationeither Noor with Isabelle in the front and Lakshmi and Mia in the back, or Lakshmi in the front and Noor and Mia in the backwould be insufferable. For a while, after the rest stop, Mia sat with Isabelle in the front, and even then, alone in the back with Noor, Lakshmi felt his energy directed like sunlight at Mia. It went on like that all afternoon, through the parking and a key-related mishap. Finally, when they were drinking beers on the roof and watching the sunset, Mia said something that betrayed a confusion between Baudelaire and Baudrillard. Noor downplayed the error, and Lakshmi added, Yeah, whats a hundred years difference? Noor froze Lakshmi out the whole night and, when she confronted him, he told her he hadnt known she could be cruel. Lakshmi had left for Boston alone at daybreak on a secret bus from Chinatown that she somehow knew about. When she got back, the phone was ringing. It was Joey. He had been calling for weeks and she had always refused to see him. But this time she felt too exhausted to argue and agreed to meet for a drink. The last thing Lakshmi remembered was Joey bringing her a second tequila. The whole time she was telling the story, I was trying to figure out which was the terrible part. At first, I thought it was the unjustness of Noor saying Lakshmi was cruel, after he had been torturing her all day. But that wasnt it. The terrible part was waking up in the morning in a bed next to Joey. Im probably not a virgin anymore, Lakshmi choked, when she saw I didnt understand. A tear glittered in her eyelashes, and another rolled down her face. I had never seen such sparse, reluctant, angry-looking tears. But how do you know? There was evidence. You meanblood? No, but there wouldnt have been. Not with all the horseback riding. She acted like it was obvious what the evidence was, but I still didnt get it. It had been a condom. Joey said he had put it on before he realized Lakshmi was passed out, and then had taken it off again without doing anything. Lakshmi didnt believe him. She said she had permanently forfeited her claim to her fathers lovethe love of the only person in the world who truly valued her. Lakshmi was my friend, so I was on her side. Yet for some reason my mind was working to figure out what she had done wrong. Had she been using Joey, to make herself feel less badly about Noor? On the other hand, wasnt that what you were supposed to do: give up on the bad boy you liked, and maturely, self-respectingly accept the attentions of a less charismatic guy who had proven his essential goodness by wanting to be with you? Wasnt that the plot of 40 percent of romantic comedies? Wasnt it what Alanis Morissette had finally done? In the bookstore, I picked up a book I had seen many times, and had never once thought of reading: The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr.Right. The Rules were basically to do the exact opposite of everything I did. You could never tell a man that you loved him, or show that you liked him, or initiate sex, or agree to have sex. The Rules closely corresponded to the list of things that Tatiana didnt do, in Eugene Onegin. She does not say: Let us defer; thereby we shall augment loves value... let us first prick vainglory with hope; then with perplexity harass a heart, and then revive it with a jealous fire.... That was itthat was the Rules. Eugene Onegin didnt contradict the Rules, but rather confirmed thembecause Tatiana didnt get Eugene Onegin. A person who had followed the Rules would have gotten Eugene Onegin. This was proven by how Tatiana herself basically got Eugene Onegin later, after she was married and had no use for him. Then, he threw himself at her feet, imploring her to have an affair with him and lie to people and ruin her life. That was the essence of the Rules: to treat the man you were interested in just like the man you werent interested in. You could never stop pretending you werent interested, not even after you were married. That was Rule 26. If at any turn, anything you did seemed like your idea, it was a huge turnoff. This was because of biology. (Biologically, hes the aggressor.) How decisively the Rules sliced through the endless debate I had been a party to all my life, over the words and deeds of peoples boyfriends. You might wonder, Is his behavior the result of bad upbringing or something in his past? Maybe. But we believe its because you didnt do the Rules. So it wasnt that my mother and aunts were wrong; the mens behavior probably was the result of some incident in their past that had left them incapable of receiving, acknowledging, or valuing genuine love. But it did you no good to know it, or to discuss it, let alone to ingeniously reconstruct what the incident had been. The only thing that did you goodbecause it hacked the mans brain and made him act the way a person who loved you would actwas for you to pretend that you didnt truly care about anything except your hair. According to the Rules, being obsessed with your hair wasnt shallow or antisocial. Neglecting your hair was antisocial, because it made other people feel like losers if they hung out with you. So was cutting your hair short, because it didnt help men to feel more manly. It didnt matter whether you looked better with short hair. In general, it didnt matter what you, in particular, were like. Rule 1, Be a Creature Unlike Any Other, made it sound like you were going to get some points for not being exactly the same as everyone else, but it turned out to mean the opposite. Basically, all your actual qualities and achievements were pointless and boring, and your real value lay in the mysterious unspoken essence that made every woman a creature unlike any other. The book repeatedly said that smart, educated women were the worst at doing the Rulesbecause they thought their fancy degrees entitled them to display their personalities. They always got their comeuppance, and were heartbroken. Nothing in The Rules was news, exactly: the eternal defeat of non-lame women, the worthlessness of their honesty, the way they so often ended up marrying lame guys whom they had initially rejected as tedious. It wasnt that I hadnt known these things, but that at some point, without realizing it, I had persuaded myself that I was differentthat my honesty and non-lameness wouldnt be punished like that, because I had some special skill, some self-sufficiency, an ability to be alone. I always had been alone, when every other person in my family had insisted on having someone around to have sex with. It was shocking to see Ivans name in my in-box, even though, or maybe because, it was no longer the white-hot one, being somehow less activated than the longer Polish name pertaining to the Count. But I felt its latent power: how it could start again, how the wire was still live. Selin, Sometimes I dont understand you at all. Why cant you do anything like a normal person? When I see how you behave it makes me feel quite helpless. I used to wonder this last year: how could you be so graceful in writing and so clumsy in life? I stared at the screen. Why was he acting as if I had complained to him? I hadnt complained to him. Who was he to tell me I didnt do anything like a normal person? Who was he all of a sudden: Mr.Normal? If you want to get laid, he continued, dont write emails. You have to... What was it nowadvice? He was talking about creating a mood of uncertainty. The man shouldnt know whether he was allowed to touch my hand. There was no wrongness underlying the machinery. In fact, if you did it right, it was amazing how well the machinery worked. The crassness of if you want to get laid, the vulgar interpretation of the machinery were both uncharacteristic and upsetting. It felt like some spell had been brokenlike he was finally telling me something he had refused to talk about before. Because, although he had never previously accounted for himself, for what had and hadnt happened between him and me, he now seemed to be answering the question I had been so careful, this time, not to ask. Man, you really screwed it up with me big time. Never tell a guy you love him until he tells you seven times first. Otherwise, you are playing a losing game. Even if he was thinking about saying he loves you, he cant now, you have destroyed the mystery. I realized that, although I had often felt hurt by things Ivan had said or written, I had never before felt that he was deliberately trying to hurt me. Was it possible that what I had written had hurt him in some unprecedented way? Was it possible that was why I had written itto hurt him? As I had been hurt, and hurt, and hurt, for two hours, on the skull pillow and on the desk? I thought about the Rules, and how I had felt they didnt apply to me. All that time, when I had been telling myself that I wasnt dependent on other people, hadnt I been holding on to the contradictory conviction that someday I wouldin the very phrase, heavy with significance, used by my mother and auntsmeet someone: someone as different from the tedious guy who wanted to marry you, as from the tedious guy who didnt want to marry you? Now Ivan himself had told me, apparently in a moment of angerdid that mean it was more or less likely to be true?that I had ruined everything by basically not doing the Rules. So maybe Ivan was the guy who didnt want to marry you, whom you had to trick every day for the rest of your life. Anyway, there are mountains of oedipal phobias between us, when towards me you seem like a little sister. Moreover, you somehow remind me of my mother. There it was again: the hard glitter of revelation. When I thought about all his little sisters, the part about a little sister made sense. The mention of his mother, though, felt gratuitous and foreign. Wasnt it older women who reminded people of their mothers? How could I be both: like a little sister, and like his mother? I thought back to Ivans mother, trying to remember what she was like. At some point, she had shown me a faded chart they had once used, to apportion household chores, back when Ivan and his four sisters still lived at homea grid indicating whose turn it was to make the cocoa at breakfast. Why did thinking about that make me feel sad? Her tone had been cheerful, and her general bearing one of brisk competence. Surely, if she had been sad, it wouldnt have been anything she would have betrayed in front of me, a hapless teen stranger. I thought again of the Rulesof Rule 3, about the first date: Avoid staring romantically into his eyes. Rule 10, about Dates 4 through Commitment Time: Act independent so that he doesnt feel that youre expecting him to take care of you. Werent they somehow the rules that one wished ones mother would follow? Of course, there was no reason for her to follow them; you couldnt, you wouldnt avoid her, the way men avoided you. Avoid staring romantically into his eyes. Was it possible that I had made Ivan feel the way I sometimes felt about my mother? May Juho said he had to ask me for advice about dating: a concept he considered to be specifically American. In Juhos world, I counted as both an American and a dating expert. Juho had been prevailed upon to visit Wellesley on the bus known as the Fuck Truck. At the ensuing dance, Juho, who considered the music to be unsuitable for dancing, struck up a conversation with a girl who also wasnt dancing, and who described herself as a very shy person who normally spent her every waking moment putting on plays in an all-women Shakespeare group. This girl had now invited Juho to return to Wellesley to see her play Polonius. Was this a date? What was the difference between going on a date and dating? Should Juho go? Would I come? I said I thought he should go, by himself, in case it was a date; if it wasnt, he would have seen Hamlet. It was a sentence I could imagine my mother saying, judiciously: In the worst case, you saw Hamlet. It worked. I could see Juho was pleased. He asked again if I didnt want to come. I pointed out that I had already seen Hamlet. But it did seem odd that Juho would now have been twice to a womens college, and I had never been to one. I found myself remembering my summer-camp friend, Jordan, who was my age, but already a junior at Smith. (She had applied to colleges a year early, because she lived in Kansas and hated her father, and Smith had given her a full scholarship.) My mother hadnt been crazy about Jordan, whom she had met when she picked me up from summer camp. Jordan was even taller than I was, she made her own clothes (mostly out of other, pre-existing clothes), and had a tattoo of half a snail, because it had gotten interrupted. She published a comics zine and was half Chinese. Whenever my mother pointed out someone she thought I should be friends with, it was always some American girl with a French braid. On the last night of camp, Jordan and I stayed up talking the whole night, because we didnt know if we would ever see each other again. We had been right: we never had seen each other again. My mother had said that I seemed unnaturally excited, asked repeatedly if I was doing drugs, and ironically tried to give me Valium so I would sleep in the car. I had never felt so awake, and didnt want to stop feeling that way. All the next year, Jordan and I exchanged letters, handwritten on the biggest pieces of paper we could find: brown bags, wrapping paper, continuous-feed printer paper. When my mother saw one of Jordans long, scroll-like letters, she said she thought Jordan seemed mentally unstable, and asked whether she was a lesbian. Once, when my mother and I were watching Law & Order on a Friday night, my mother had asked whether I was a lesbian: otherwise why was I here with her, instead of out on a date? It seemed sort of rude, but I answered as politely as I could. She wasnt satisfied by anything I said, until I pointed out that, if I had been a lesbian, I would have told her already. Then she clearly felt relievedYou would, right? We have no secrets, right?and we could go back to watching the district attorneys prosecute the offenders. Last year, when I got to college, Jordan and I had sometimes exchanged emails. Jordan wrote increasingly about her housemates, two of whom were mysteriously in love with the third, Pepper, who was snotty and insufferable. After six months or so, Jordan said that she and Pepper had kissed, and that now she, too, loved Pepper. I didnt get it. How could Jordan love a human being named Pepper? Was Jordan a lesbian? Was that something my mother had been right about? At camp, Jordan and I had talked for hours about crushes we had on guys. It hadnt occurred to me to apply to womens colleges. In high school, I had noticed how classes, already intolerable, became exponentially worse whenever the boys werent there. Even the girls who were smart seemed to care less than usual about making good points. This was especially the case when the teacher was also a woman. Anyway, I didnt want to be nurtured in an environment that was set up for me to excel. I wanted to do whatever was the most real and rigorous. Obviously, everything would be set up for boys. So what? I would work ten times harder than they did, and everyone would eventually acknowledge I was doing a better job. The more Juho told me about Lara, the girl from Wellesley, the less she corresponded to any of the stereotypes I had heard of. She was Mexican and had grown up in Mexico City, but her mom was from England, so she had a British accent. She had three brothers, was obsessed with theater, had acted since she was little, but was pathologically shy. Hearing about what a specific person she was, it occurred to me that Wellesley must be full of all different kinds of people, just like Harvard was, only they were all girls. That made it seem exciting. But clearly they missed the boys, and had to bring them over on some kind of a bus. Radcliffe sent a letter offering me a travel grant, but for less than half the study-abroad tuition. The Peruvian frozen food guy emailed saying I could work for him, pending my submission of a full-body photograph. The Lets Go Turkey editor, Sean, kept calling on the phone with ideas to expand the coverage of Central Anatolia. But I had gone to Ankara every summer of my life, so how did Central Anatolia count as travel? As I was walking by the Science Center, staring at the ground, I ran into Peter, who asked about my summer plans. I told him about the deficient Russia grant, the visually oriented frozen food supplier, and the Central Anatolian itinerary that gave American people a nervous breakdown. I had meant it as a funny story about how all the options had something wrong with them, but Peter seemed to understand it differently. He asked if I had ever traveled alone in Turkey, and said what an incredible experience it would be, and seemed to take it as a given that I was going to go to both Turkey and Russia. I dont know if its really enough money to go to Russia, though. Why, how much is the grant? When I said twelve hundred dollars, Peter laughed and said that the study-abroad programs overcharged by orders of magnitude. More economical arrangements could be made privately, with greater benefit to local hosts. Moreover, everyone in every country wanted free labor: all I had to do was find someone with an interesting job and offer to make them coffee, and that would be an internship, and I would learn just as much as from a three-thousand-dollar American program. Struck by Peters way of viewing things, by the way he made the world sound so manageable and small and large at the same time, I wondered aloud whether I should try to work something out with the frozen food guy. Wouldnt it be pleasing in a narrative way for everything to tie together like that? Peter laughed, but with a slightly concerned expression, and said he was going to put me in touch with one of his friends. I hadnt had a clear mental picture of Juhos new girlfriend, Lara, and realized that I had almost expected her to look blurry. Of course, she turned out to have a normal level of material reality, with gray eyes, dimples, and tangled-looking hair that was gold and brown mixed together. She was wearing ill-cut boxy overalls that somehow managed to look both cool and flattering. Why was that the thing you had to do when you saw a girl: to prosecute whether and in what way she was beautifulas Lara, I realized, was? With guys, some of them were physically repellent or appealing, but a lot of them initially presented as neutral, and there wasnt that immediate, urgent-feeling cognitive puzzle to slot them in, as there was with literally every female person, including ones own self, in windows and storefronts. Sometimes it seemed to me that I looked interesting, mysterious, and sculptural. Other times I thought that I didnt look like anything, that nothing matched together or corresponded to anything or had any kind of grace or proportion or meaning, that the posture was deformed and hateful, like a sign of laziness or obsequiousness or some other personality flaw. The second most striking thing about Lara, after her beauty, was her eagerness to be liked: not the overeagerness that drove a person away, but a radiant, Bambi-like hope, that seemed, in this instance, to be specially directed at meas if I were a particular friend of Juhos whom she needed to love her. (So, she loved Juho.) Juho read a Spanish textbook and listened to Spanish cassettes in his sleep. Over spring break, he went to Mexico City with Lara, and when he came back, he could speak Spanish. Lara was going to take a Finnish immersion class over the summer. How quickly it had all happened! Juho and I had been friends for months, but it would never have been a plan for us to go to different countries and learn languages because of each other. Juho had told Lara that, if they were going to think about staying together for more than a year, she would have to learn Finnish and develop her own relationship to the culture, because he had to move back to Helsinki after his fellowship. He had seen too many Finnish people return from overseas with non-Finnish-speaking partners, and the partners ended up totally dependent, and everyone got depressed. After Lara graduated, she was supposed to spend six whole months alone in Helsinki. That way she could see if she liked Helsinki enough to live therefor itself, and not because of Juho. Where will you be? I asked. Somewhere else. Or even in Helsinki. We just wouldnt be in contact. I felt relieved to learn that there was some logic, after all, behind who ended up with whom, because this plan sounded crazy to me, and yet I could imagine a person different from me thinking it would be fun. Clearly, Lara was such a person, and that was why she and Juho were together. At dinner the next week, Juho said he had to ask me for advice. He was worried about Lara, because they had spent the weekend together and at some point she had started crying uncontrollably. I asked what had been happening right before the crying. Juho said they had been talking about the six months she was going to spend alone in Helsinki after graduation. I said that maybe Lara didnt want to spend six months alone in Helsinki. Juho said that couldnt be the case, because they had discussed the plan at length and Lara had agreed that it was reasonable. It could be the kind of plan that seems reasonable when you talk about it, but if you have to actually do it, it makes you sad, I said. I could imagine feeling that way. You? Juho exclaimed. But you lived in a Hungarian village! That was true. I had stayed with random people, tried to learn Hungarian, and hadnt talked to Ivan for weeks. But most of that hadnt been Ivans idea. Definitely, he had never said that I had to learn Hungarian, or wasnt allowed to talk to him. What if he had? On the one hand, it might have been nice for my study of Hungarian to be a recognized, legitimate project, and not something weird I was doing in secret. On the other, when I tried to imagine living in Budapest for six months and knowing that Ivan was there, but wasnt talking to me, on purpose... well, it felt at least as bad as my actual situation. I went to the Caf Gato Rojo to meet Peters friend Seongho. He was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, and told me about the self-directed program of study he had undertaken in Moscow last year, having suddenly realized, in the course of his dissertation research into Korean Communist factions, that he urgently needed to be able to read Russian. He slid a piece of paper across the table. On it were the long telephone numbers pertaining to some geneticists who had rented him a room in the outer suburbs, and to a literature graduate student who had taught him enough grammar to read Communist newspapers. There was also the pager number of a guy named Igor in Queens who would, for two hundred dollars, get you a visa invitation letter. Was it possible that everything was so... not easy, exactly, since it sounded like kind of a pain, but so feasible? Seongho made all his problems sound funny. He said he would vouch for me to the geneticists, and would tell them I wasnt an axe murderer. (How could he know that?) I started trying to think of people in Moscow whose job I could learn about by making their coffee. I remembered an English-language Russian literary journal I had occasionally attempted to read. I found it in the library. There on the copyright page was an editors email address, ending, thrillingly, with msk.su. I took the journal into a carrel, determined to read it from cover to cover. From the first few pages, I got a depressed, hopeless feeling that reminded me of why I had never previously succeeded in reading this journal. Serdiuk realized what it was that had suddenly brought the singer Polyp Pigdick to mind, I read. I flipped forward to another story. Someone called Vic the Snot-Faced Drooler was commenting on a woman with four tits, two backsides, and a plait of hair as thick as your fist. Yet, for some reason, this, in a story by a third author, struck me as funny: Why are you wearing a gas mask? asked Pissoff. Have you got a leak from the gas oven? And why do you limp on both legs? Karmalyutov answered his question with a question. Are you an old sea wolf? I sent the editor an email, enthusing about Pissoff and Karmalyutov, asking whether, since I was going to be in Moscow in Augusthow bold it feltthere was any work I could do to further their interests. She wrote back, asking me to pass out flyers about her journal to different famous professors at Harvard. I replied, implying that I might not be able to pass out flyers if she didnt also think of something for me to do in Moscow, and she said she would think it over. Priya was also doing Lets Go, in Nepal. We went together to the womens self-defense training session. A giant ex-convict wearing a space suit pretended to mug you. That was his job, now. It was demonstrated to us how we should knee him in the balls while screaming, No. The ex-convict spoke with professional pride about the unconscious processes according to which criminals chose their targets. He cited a study where several violent offenders were shown a video of people walking through a shopping mall, and independently identified the same marks. It wasnt the wealthiest-looking people, but those who seemed to lack self-confidence or alertness. Priya knew a lot of Lets Go lore, because one of her admirers was a law student, and those were the people who handled most of the legal claims. According to Priyas law student, the last time a Lets Go had sent a single woman to Turkey, she had been sexually assaulted, and had tried to file a negligence claim against her editor. Was that true? Definitely, people were always trying to sue Lets Go, but it was usually for libel. Part of Lets Go training was learning to write in a special tone. The tone was called witty and irreverent, and was also employed in The Unofficial Guide to Life at Harvard, a book that was freely distributed to undergraduates and that we had all read many timesat least I apparently had, because whole sentences, mostly from restaurant write-ups, seemed to have been burned into my memory. Lines like, The Fishery serves up huge portions of fresh but mediocre fish to a family-oriented clientele, impressed me with their judicious apportionment of strengths and weaknesses, as did the writers easy conversance with social types I had never heard of (chatty alterna-folk, relaxed Gen-X waitrons). Each researcher-writer was assigned three Boston-area businesses to write about for next years Unofficial Guide. Mine were Vintage Treasures, Bobs Muffler Repair, and Dr.Stoats Comics Vault, all in Coolidge Corner. It was satisfying to have a reason to go to a neighborhood I rarely visited, and Bob was nice, saying he could give students a 10 percent discount on mufflers. Still, it was hard to think of anything witty or irreverent to say about any of these places, since most Harvard students didnt have cars or buy antiques and, even at Dr.Stoats Comics Vault, the median age seemed to be forty-five. Who were those grown men, paying good money for figurines and trading cards: a commodity about which I didnt even know enough to say if it was a large selection? The figure of Ham came to my mind. Was Dr.Stoat known to him? It seemed likely. I hadnt had any interaction with Ham since that party. Back at home, I reread the restaurant section of The Unofficial Guide from beginning to end. It seemed to encapsulate a specific worldview, almost a specific persona: one you came to inhabit as you were reading. Just as, when you read a nineteenth-century novel, you entered into the persona of a nineteenth-century Christian male member of the propertied classes, so, too, when you read the restaurant reviews, did you become a person whose lifestyle required constant infusions of coffee, which couldnt be burned or mediocre or purveyed by a nationwide chain; a person who held the rich in contempt and considered overpriced and overrated to be the worst insults, yet who could, under the right circumstances, identify and appreciate a memorable venison pastrami. You were continually engaged in destroying yourself in an inevitable, prestigious, yet shameful way, hinted at in sentences like: That (crabless) crab rangoon will go great with the hangover youre going to have tomorrow. And how powerfully the phrase (crabless) crab rangoon summed up the disconnect between the way things were described, and the way they actually were. By a similar operation, the write-up of Wholesome Fresh moved me almost to tears. Supposedly open 24 hours, Wholesome Fresh offers pretty much everything your heart desires. Hearty sandwiches. Hot dishes. Sushi. Chocolate Sauce. Paprika. Napkins. There it was, finally on display: the gap between the idea that Wholesome Fresh promulgated about itself, in a nave or sinister way, and what it felt like to actually be there. What a relief to see it articulated! How alone a person was normally, walking down a street, trying to choose between different businesses. It wasnt the most glamorous part of life, or the one that was most often discussed, but it was so constant, like a heartbeat, like the waves: the question of where and how to spend the money that had been wrung from the world at such cost. Nobody really talked about it, except the advertisements, but the advertisements werent trying to tell the truth; the advertisements said simply that Wholesome Fresh was Wholesome Fresh. In some way it seemed to me that The Unofficial Guide was the most truthful book, more so than Either/Orbecause it was describing the exact concrete situations you were in, specific to time and place, and was updated every year. I met Sean, the Turkey editor, to go over my itinerary. Heavyset, with glasses and pockmarked skin, Sean had a pleasantly conspiratorial, over-caffeinated demeanor, like a newspaper editor in a movie. He openly disparaged Lets Gos existing Turkey coverage, acting as if we both knew that any sane traveler would prefer to use the Lonely Planet guides, which were written by actual travel writers: the kind of people who lived in other countries and called themselves expats. (Were my parents expats? Somehow, it felt like only British and Australian people were expats, just like only Russian and Polish nobles were migrs.) At the same time, the fact that Lets Go relied on clueless students who were sent out for a few weeks every summer was, in a way, its selling pointone in which Sean himself seemed to believe. Lets Go didnt have enough money to pay real researchers, and the travelers didnt have any money, either, so Lets Go was the only realistic guide. My itinerary was Central Anatolia, the Mediterranean coast, and North Cyprus, which Turkey considered to be a part of Turkey, though nobody else thought that. The assignment packet contained marked-up photocopies of the relevant pages from last years edition, along with a list of new places to add. My mother said that the itinerary was impossible: nobody could go to so many places in seven weeks, nor was there any need for them to do so. What tourist had ever thought of visiting two-thirds of these places? Well, theyre supposed to be off the beaten path, I said. Theres a reason why nobody beat a path there, replied my mother. After consulting my aunt Arzu, she sent me a revised itinerary. More than half of the stops had been removed. As compensation, she had added two stops on the Black Sea, where we had connections. But the other researcher, a Turkish grad student, was doing the Black Sea. I couldnt just decide to go there. My mother said that was exactly what I had to do. I felt deep fatigue at the vastly differing worldviews of my mother and Lets Go. The places my mother was the most adamant about my not visiting were North Cyprus, a site of previous violent disputes, and Hatay, on the Syrian border. My mother wept and said there was no reason for me to go there, there was no advantage and she forbade it. My father said that North Cyprus was supposed to be beautiful, and maybe I could take my cousin Evren. He didnt have anything bad to say about Hatay, either; it was only a couple of hours from Adana, which was also on my itinerary. I could pick up Evren from Adana and we could go to Cyprus together. When he described it, it almost sounded fun. PART FOUR Summer June In my heart I didnt see the need for a backpack. Wouldnt I be better off with a suitcase? Especially now that suitcases all had wheels. People never even talked about that anymore, and acted as if it had always been that way. Yet, all through my childhood, everyone had been yelling, Youll hurt your back! and wrenching suitcases out of each others hands, in an effort to personally be the one who hurt their back. In the end, I bought the least backpack-like backpack: it was all black and convertible, meaning the straps could be hidden, causing it to resemble a giant misshapen duffel bag. If you unzipped another zipper, part of it fell off and turned out to be a detachable daypack. Many people watched with interest as I dragged this item off the conveyor at the Ankara baggage claim. I unzipped the straps, worked them over my shoulders and, ignoring the openmouthed stares of a family of six, trudged to the taxi line. Lemon cologne, leatherette seat covers, and that smell when you opened the cab windowwhat even was it? Tar? Cigarettes? Some kind of trees? What was so exciting about just recognizing things, almost regardless of what the things were? The unlit hall at my grandmothers building, the stone floor and stairs that always seemed to be in the process of being washed by someone suffering from back pain. Even now, they were darkened and damp and smelled like mud, because dust here wasnt allowed to be dust, but was flooded with water. Whenever anyone went away, everyone else cried, and dumped out a pot of water on the stone stairsso they would come back quickly like water. That was another time when the stairs and floor were wet. My grandmother opened the door, skinny and Muppet-like, with her giant grin and her booming voice. Selin, my beautiful girl! Welcome, welcome! Mercy, whats on her back! The hulking carved wardrobes and cupboards and sideboards; crystal ashtrays, embroidered cloths, stacked bezique counters, decks of cards that my aunts knew how to shuffle and manipulate with terrifying expertness and an absent expression. The polite, urgent speech of newscasters, coming from the wooden television console. The indescribable smell, soapy yet human. The framed photograph of Atatrk wearing a fur hat. The oil painting of my grandmother when she was young, with an expression she still had now, skeptical and amused and imperious. Ah! Ah! Getting old is a great misfortune! My grandmother sat down and smiled into my face, leaning forward and listing everything that was hurting, which included her kidneys and some things I didnt understand. As always, she alluded to a nail that doctors had put in her back. A paralyzing wave of tenderness. Was it possible she was happy? Her big smile, her shouting, Sit down, be comfortable, youre in your own house now, shall I put on the tea? Soon it was time to face a problem I had tried not to think about: the problem of sleep. Nothing else had ever been like the sleeplessness of Ankara. Sleep evaded and evaded you, and by the time it came it wasnt a blessing but a curse. Now, the more you slept, the more you were eating into the next day, destroying what was left of it with depressingness, sealing the doom of the next night. When I was little, I couldnt understand what was happeningwhy we had to suffer like that. It was explained to me that this was a normal part of travel, called jet lag. My mother offered me Valium, telling me not to put it in my novel. Once, though, the Valium had left me feeling even more fatigued and hopeless, yet still unable to fall asleep, so after that I didnt take it anymore. Instead I read, finishing all the books I had brought in the first two or three nights, reading them over and over for the rest of the summer. I still remembered large sections of those books, which were about American children who got leukemia or were obsessed with babysitting. There was an English series, too, about some small children in Cornwall who were somehow delegated to save humanity by discovering King Arthurs grail: a task clearly exceeding their strength and abilities. This went on for several depressing and yet insufficiently numerous volumes. The English children always did encounter Magic, or seemed about to. The girl in The Secret Garden knew about Magic because she was born in India where there are fakirs. This was confusing, because my grandmother often talked about fakir. This was the Turkish word for poor person, and was uttered in a tone full of pity, regret, and sentiment. My grandmothers house was known as a place where anything might disappear and turn out to have been given to the fakir. My mother was still upset that he had gotten her bicycle, at some point in the 1950s. How hard I had tried to like those trips to Ankara, to feel that something interesting was happeningand not that I had been stricken somehow from the register of the living. It was something I had never admitted, and could only bring myself to think now that I was here without my mother. It would be ungrateful and traitorous to think that it had been depressing; yet I had been depressed. I could barely form the words to myself, feeling how much my mother would disbelieve me, and would say I was doing revisionism. Was I doing revisionism? Had it actually been wonderful? Of course, it had. Ankara had always been a place of treats: beautiful golden rings and trinkets, new clothes, quilted robes, red slippers, chocolate-covered orange rind, candied chestnuts, pale golden apricots and grapes. My grandmother always made marvelous jam: sour cherry, Seville orange, wild strawberry. My mother took me on special outings, just the two of us. The Flamingo Patisserie had the best lemonade. My mother would debate ordering profiteroles. I encouraged her: I always wanted it to be a special day, a day when my mother finally got a treat. And I felt pleasantly disinterested to say, about the profiteroles, Why dont you have one, since I didnt particularly like them myself. My indifference to cream and puff pastry was spoken of admiringly by my mother and aunts. But my mother almost never did order profiteroles. Near the Flamingo Patisserie was the Paabahe glassware shop, where we would admire the em-i blbl carafes, the extravagantly gilded and specifically shaped glasses for Turkish tea, rak, champagne, and cognac: the gilt sets blending, in my mind, with the elaborate collections of personal effects on display at Atatrks mausoleum, which we also visited sometimes, in a taxi, though not as frequently aswhen we had gotten up early enoughthe Hittite Museum. The best part of the Hittite Museum was when my mother read from the stone tablets with hieroglyphs. One was about a goat who lost his clothes, and took a vest from somebodys clothesline. Another involved a bird who was studying to be a plumber. On some level, I knew that my mother was inventing the stories, and not reading them, but on another levelwhen she pointed out the glyphs of the Two Crossed Monkey Wrenches and the Broken FaucetI knew she was reading them. When we came to another tablet on the other side of the hall, by which time I had all but forgotten the goat, my mother said, thoughtfully: Ah, of coursethis one is about the goats neighbor. The goats neighbor had hung his laundry on a clothesline and, just when he had been looking forward to wearing his nice clean vest...! If anyone else had been telling the story, the neighbor would have been angry. In my mothers version, it was a gentle and delightful mystery. Where was the vest? Had the bird flown off with it? But the bird didnt like clothes; they interfered with the plumbing. The goat, on the other hand: hadnt he complimented that vest a few too many times? Well, I think Ill just have a few words with the goat. By then we would both be helpless with laughter. SoI had been wrong to think it had been bad. The thought of how I had wronged my mother caused me so much pain that I started racking my mind for counter-evidence. And it hadnt all been like the Hittite Museum; usually we woke up too late to get anywhere before it closed, because I wasnt the only one with trouble sleeping; it was even worse for my mother, who often drifted off only after daybreak. The living room doors with their brass handles and frosted glass panes remained closed until the mid-afternoon sun shone directly and depressingly through the front-facing windows. The terror of waking herthe terror of her strained voice. Other times, visitors prevented us from leaving. Heavily made-up women sat for hours on the sofa, drinking tea. They refused the tea, with a pained expression, but my mother or grandmother or aunt insisted, and then they drank it with a pained expression, while conversing. This entailed relaying to each other the varyingly dismaying or witty remarks that had been made to them by other people, inserting he said or she said between almost every other word: And then, she said, enay, she said, you, she said, dont, she said, understand anything. Sometimes, there were long stretches when nobody said anything but ah, ah, ah, or, really. I started to go into a cycle, like the one in The Seducers Diary where Cordelia kept arguing one way and the other over whether anything bad had happened to her. It couldnt have been depressing, because my mother had worked so hard to make it not be depressing. And yetwas it possible that how hard my mother worked was part of why it had been depressing? I knew how vigilantly my mother had protected me from the things that had depressed her as a childlike having to kiss the old peoples hands on holidays. She had thought their hands were gross, and felt insulted to have to kiss them, but they made her do it. My mother said that that had been wrong. She said that children were people, whose dignity and privacy were worthy of respect. She was the only person I had ever met or heard of who thought or said anything like that. It was explained to the other relatives that Selin wasnt going to kiss anyones hands. Fine, fine, let Selin not kiss, they would say, in the voice of someone humoring my mother in how she spoiled me. I always knew that this way in which I was disappointing people and making a spectacle of myself was a favor bestowed upon me by my mother, who was sparing me a bad experience that she had not been spared, and I felt guilty toward everyone: toward my mother for not appreciating how she always defended and protected me, toward the old people whose hands I didnt kiss, and toward my cousins who did have to kiss the old peoples hands. Arzus son Murat was four years older than me, and obsessed with knives. Insofar as I existed in his consciousness, it seemed to be as a source of annoyance, because I was taller than he was, though I was younger and a girl. Murat became convinced that the secret to my unnatural height lay in the Flintstones chewable multivitamins that my mother dispensed to me out of her suitcase. My mother immediately began sharing the Flintstones vitamins with Murat, and after that she always mailed or brought him his own supply. The effect on his psyche when, after taking the vitamins for a whole year, he didnt surpass me in height... Arzu said the reason I was so tall was because the chicken in America was full of estrogen. This angered my mother. But why was I still thinking about that, now that I was long past the age where anyone could expect me to kiss their hand? Maybe my father was right and I tended to dwell on imagined slights and bad feelings from the past. My grandmother was reading the newspaper in bed, in the small side room where she usually slept, still drinking tea, which she said didnt keep her awake. As usual, I had been given the master bedroom. I took a shower in the bathtub that coughed when you turned it on, changed into shorts and a T-shirt, and sat up in bed to read the Central Anatolia and Ankara parts of Lets Go. It was incredible to see that guy, the Unofficial Guide person, invoking the neighborhoods of Ankara: a place that had always felt somehow un-described to me, because so few of the people I knew had ever been there, except the people who were actually from there, and who didnt feel a particular need to describe it. The places that Lets Go recommended were preceded by the thumbs-up logo, which was also the apostrophe in Lets Go on the cover, and which made me feel badly about myself, because I had never gone hitchhiking. Only one site in Ankara had a thumbs-up: the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. What relief I felt when, reading the description, I understood that it was the place my mother called the Hittite Museum! So, we had been right to like itand they had been right to identify it as having value. At the top, Lets Go said that Ankara wasnt worth a special trip, if you didnt have a reason to go, because it was so much less interesting than Istanbul. The comparison struck me as strange. They were totally different cities. Nothing about them was the same. I decided I would make the coverage of Ankara more positive. I woke up at ten the next morning, realizing that I had actually been asleep. How long had it been since I had thought of Fatma or Berrak, the two women who helped my grandmother at home? Fatma lived outside the city, and came once a week. She had a large sculptural face set in an expression of kindness, and acted like a relative. I did my laundry in secret, hiding the clothes afterward, so she wouldnt iron them; but she found them and ironed them anyway, even the T-shirts and underwear. Why did I want to cry when I saw those perfectly stacked squares? Berrak, who came every day, was skinny with a lopsided grin, and looked like a teenager, though she was in her twenties, and was married to the doorman. She lived downstairs. My grandmother ordered Berrak around without saying please or thank you, like she was always already annoyed at her. Why was Berrak viewed with skepticism? It might have been because of her political views, which she shared with the doorman, who was a Marxist, and also religiousnot privately, like my grandmother, but in a way that was critical of secularism and of the United States. On the other hand, it could have been less about politics than about her tendency to say unpleasant things. Once, Berrak had spoken in my mothers presence of the kind of woman who has gotten to be fifty years old but doesnt own any property. Isnt it kind of funny that shes a Marxist, but despises people who dont... own property? I asked. Its very funny, my mother said, not laughing at all. On another occasion, Berrak had hung wet sheets over the tops of the doors to dry. Remind me why thats not a good thing to do? I said thoughtfully, as though I had simply forgotten. My mother and aunts stared at me with identical sorrowful expressions. A door, it was pointed out to me, wasnt designed as a load-bearing element; that wasnt part of the great plan for doors, they werent made for people to ride on, but simply to exist on their hinges, regulating access to rooms. When they had done that, they had done enough, without also carrying the weight of great dripping wet sheets. And what possible reason could there be, what possible benefit to be derived from rejecting the hallowed product of human ingenuity that was the clothesline? So, they wrote a book about Turkey, and they sent you to fix the mistakes? I heard in my grandmothers voice the family partisanship that would have made her swear up and down that of course I could fix any kind of book, as well as mild skepticism about the possible value of this particular book. I spent the first two days with my grandmother in the living room where she passed most of her time, sitting with her knees doubled up in her green armchair, smoking Marlboros, drinking glass after glass of tea, solving the crossword puzzle, getting mad at the neologisms. Modern Turkish had only been around for sixty years, so it was still changing. Arabic and Persian loanwords were periodically replaced with equivalents that were supposed to be more Turkish, but were sometimes just made up. It was annoying to older people. No sooner had my grandmother come to accept simge, a bogus word for symbol, than she had to put up with the brazen foisting upon the public of imge, for image. My grandmother often spoke in proverbs that I didnt understand. I was used to tuning them out. Now it occurred to me that, if this had been a foreign countryif it had been RussiaI would have been trying to learn the proverbs. I started writing them down. Some featured my old friend, the fakir. The fakir chicken lays eggs one at a time: that was about not being in a hurry, and seemed somehow directed at me. Another saying, The egg didnt like its shell, was used for people who tried to distance themselves from where they came from, or who disrespected their parents. I did some fact-checking, using the rotary phone next to my grandmothers armchair. My grandmother insisted on evacuating the armchair for the occasion, and sat across from me on the sofa, beaming at me and commenting on my grammar. I planned out the sentences in advance. Good day, might it be possible for me to request some information regarding... My grandmother said approvingly that I wasnt like most young girls, who said ehh all the time, and said thing when they couldnt think of a word. Yes: they sounded normal, and I didnt. At my mothers urging, my grandmother and I went out to buy a cell phone for me to carry around. I couldnt buy a phone by myself; it had to be registered with a citizenship card. My own citizenship card didnt have a photograph. This was normal for children, but at age fifteen you were supposed to have one put in. The customs officers still let you in, with a U.S. passport and a faceless Turkish citizenship card. But, once you were there, you couldnt buy a telephone. How elegant my grandmother looked, with her pumps and matching handbag. We picked out an Ericsson phone the size of a loaf of bread. My grandmother shouted at me how much she loved me and how she would miss me when I was gone. Tears sprang to her eyes because of how differently her life had turned out than she thought: everyone was in America, she had only two grandchildren, there were some questions of communication, which she never specified, but she probably meant that I spoke Turkish imperfectly, and my cousin David didnt speak Turkish at all. My grandmother always quickly added how much she loved David and me: how much she loved looking at pictures of us, and thinking about us. She was grinning broadly the whole time she said these things, like it was all delightful. Ah! Ah! How I will look for you when youre gone! My grandmother seemed shocked and upset when, on the third day, I actually left the house, though I had told her repeatedly that this would happen. I had set the alarm for eight-thirty, feeling terror that it would jerk me into the state of despair and exhaustion where I couldnt do the things I was supposed to, and that I would fail and have a nervous breakdown. But once I had managed to calm my grandmother and remove myself from the house, everything was easier than I had anticipated. The taxi driver already knew how to get to the bus station. Once you got there, it was basically peoples job to answer your questions about bus schedules. You didnt have to explain anything, or account for anything, or manifest love. If anyone got annoyed at you, they couldnt cry, or scream at you, or accuse you of offending them, and at any point you could just leave. It was totally different from being in your family. I bought an olive roll and tea at a pastry counter, and tried to separate the euphoria of freedom, which seemed legitimate, from the satisfaction that my bill came out to less than a dollar, which felt suspect. How satisfying it was to go to an address in last years edition, and find that the building, location, and hours were either already correct, or, better yet, slightly incorrect but easily correctable. This was the most exciting part: learning that the truth was something that really could be verified, and put in a book. Sometimes, an address or landmark in the book would turn out not to exist. At first, this gave me a sinking feeling. But when I made inquiries, I almost always found an older person who was happy to explain. The street had two different names, or the bus route had changed because of the new metro. I was even complimented for noticing: Most people in this neighborhood dont remember that it was like that, but you remember. I would explain about Lets Go, and more than once I was told that Americans did things right, they actually checked things, not like here in Turkey where we just hoped for the best. I felt excited when I saw a plaque outside the Hittite Museum, announcing that it had won the 1997 European Museum of the Year Award from the Council of Europe. Then I felt troubled. What was it about being here that made a person feel relief at such things? The Council of Europe? It was one of my core beliefs that real worth was independent of what some European or American people happened to have heard of. And yet... what was value, if it wasnt conferred by some people? A daunting thought: How would I eventually root out from my mind all the beliefs that I hated? A famous eight-thousand-year-old fertility goddess sat on a throne, her pendulous breasts hanging down almost from her neck, her stomach flopping over her thighs, her facewhat there was of itblurry and stupid-looking, because her face didnt matter. Something was falling between her legs. I knew that feminists liked it when societies worshipped mothers. Why didnt I want to look at her? The Bronze Age girl known as the Hasanolan figurine was about ten inches tall, made mostly of silver. Her face, a hammered gold mask, wore an expression of great sadness. Gold sashes crossed her silver body and gold bands encircled her ankles. There was something sexy about the ankle-bands. I could tell she wasnt empowering. The way her arms were clasped around her made her seem either cold or afraid, and she was too thin. But she was beautifullithe, doll-like, eminently portable. You wanted to move her through the world. In that sense, she seemed exciting and free. Someone had made a life-sized diorama of a Neolithic household, modeled on ruins found near Ankara. Five eyeless clay bull-heads of varying sizes were arranged on the whitewashed walls. An electric fire glowed in a white fireplace. In the middle of the white floor, a shallow circular pit contained two human skeletons in fetal position. The scene looked like a puzzle, a murder mystery. At the same time, it had a tidy, self-contained quality that reminded me of my grandmothers apartment. When Arzus cousin enay saw my backpack, she stared openmouthed. But surely you cant carry that on your back. Thats what I said! my grandmother exclaimed, immediately adding, in my defense: But she carries it! My strong girl, maallah, she carries everything. I put on the backpack, so they could see. Truly, she carries it, Aunt enay murmured. But, Selin, can you walk? Tell me that. I took a few steps around the living room. enay was staring at me with admiration and dismay. Everything on her back like a yrk, she said, alluding to an Anatolian nomadic people. Hamal, hamal, shes become a hamal, said Aunt Arzu, when she saw the backpack. Hamal were the street porters you still sometimes saw lugging three-hundred-pound loads up and down hills. Later, in an anthropological museum, I saw some Ottoman saddle-packs that the street porters wore under their loads. They really did look like my backpack. My biggest problem was nightlife. You couldnt check it by phone, because nobody there answered the phones. Even if they did, they couldnt give you a witty, irreverent description of the atmosphere or the clientele. What research can you do in a bar? Arzu asked, with a pained expression. But clearly bars were just where I did have to do research, not just for Lets Go, but so I would understand the human condition. The longer I lived, the more evident it became that going out and getting drunk were the things people cared the most about. They thought you were putting on an act if you said you were more interested in anything else. Even Lets Go, which was written by people who supposedly cared about human achievement, was always implying that museums were somewhere you went to seem high-minded, and that the thing that was actually important and desirable was knowing which were the right bars and clubs. Nothing that Arzu said contradicted the central importance of bars and clubs. It was just that, for her, the important thing was to keep me from going. There was nobody who thought bars and clubs didnt matter. Even when I was little, there was a point at family dinners when someone invariably made the joke: So, what now? To the discotheque? And, laughing: Selin is going to the discotheque. The joke had been... what? That I wasnt allowed to go to the discotheque? That I didnt want to go to the discotheque? That I didnt know about the discothequeI had never seen its giant mirrored face winking at me in its significance? Later, I was wandering around an enormous warehouse-like building called No Parking, trying to figure out whether it was a bar or a club, and who the people were. Club kids, grim politicos, well-heeled socialites? I felt a tap on my shoulder. Excuse me, miss, said a man in a suit, but your car is outside. You have the wrong person, I said. Im not expecting a car. Forgive me, Miss Selin, he said with a little smile, sending a chill down my spine, but the car was sent precisely for you, by a lady who gave a very detailed description. As he said detailed, he glanced surreptitiously up and down my person, as if admiring how correct the description had been. I followed him outside. Another man in a suit was standing beside a parked car. I understood who the second man was: an employee of MT, the central Turkish intelligence agency, which was where Arzu worked. I had felt I was being followed, but hadnt believed it. I burst into tears. My arm wont reach that far. Do you know this expression? Arzu asked. Like there was any knowledge involved. If something happens, Arzu said urgently. I was familiar with this way of talking about my life as a liability to older people. The way my mother would say, her face transfigured with horror, that she dreamed I had been raped, and thought it had been a sign that in real life I was in trouble and had needed her. I kept telling my grandmother I was going to leave, and she kept not believing me and saying I could go another day. Finally I just left, early one morning, leaving a note. I didnt specify my destination. Nonetheless, when I got off the bus in Tokat, I was personally greeted by a civil servant with the state hydraulic works. The subject of Tokat had been a long discussion with my mother, who said there couldnt possibly be anything to see there. Tokat hadnt been in last years Lets Go. Sean had given me a half page of research, with a quote from Strabos Geography: There on account of the multitude of prostitutes, outsiders resort in great numbers and keep holiday. Tokat province, on the way to Zile, had apparently been where Julius Caesar had said, Veni, vidi, vici, after killing a lot of people. It didnt sound like a huge Tokat endorsement from Julius Caesar. The civil servant, Arif bey, insisted that I stay at his house. His wife made a bed for me on the sofa. The houseplants were wearing crocheted outfits. Arif bey was interested in my Walkman. When he saw I wasnt listening to Turkish music, he tried to give me all his Sezen Aksu tapes. She is our sparrow, he explained in a voice full of sentiment. Sezen Aksus songs started out promisingly, but eventually she always started doing the thing where it just sounded like she was wailing with histrionic grief and trying to make other people feel badly. I knew from music theory class that, when Middle Eastern music sounded like wailing, or like it was out of tune, it was because our earsmy earshad been desensitized by the conventions of Western music. The Middle Eastern scale had twenty-four tones per octave and was actually more true and real than the twelve-tone version that European people had invented to make a piano work. But I still didnt like to listen to more than one or two Sezen Aksu songs in a row. For the next few towns, I was met at the station by government employees. In Kayseri, Turkeys pastrma capital, an actual colonel from the army showed up at my hostel and took me to dinner at a military restaurant. He told me three different times how I probably didnt realize how lucky I was to study at Harvard Universityhow many Turkish kids would cut off their ears to have such an opportunity. At some point, he asked what I was studying, and when I said Russian literature, he almost had a heart attack. I kept forgetting that Turkish army people were still mad about... the Crimean War? In the hostel library, which had mostly English books, I found a 1950s introduction to Turkey, published by the U.S. Army. It basically said that Russia and the Ottomans had always been at war. When the Ottomans lost Hungary in 1699so, Hungary was involvedRussia renewed its attempt to seize the Turkish Straits, so they could get to the Mediterranean. Russias age-old ambition for conquest is, of course, familiar to all of us. She is still at it. She has been at Turkeys throat for nearly 400 years, and this knowledge will enable you to understand why every Turkish schoolboy hates Russia. You will meet many Turks who have had relatives and ancestors killed in wars with Russia. Other Turkish people have not forgotten that it was Czar Nicholas I of Russia who sneeringly referred to Turkey as the sick man of Europe. Of course I knew the line about the sick man, but hadnt realized that it had been said by a Russian person, or that this remark in particular had given rise to the Eastern Question. The Eastern Question, too, was something I had heard of: like the Woman Question, it turned up in nineteenth-century novels. The Eastern Question was essentially, How do we divide up all the Ottomans stuff? It wasnt so different from the Woman Question, which was about whether women could have jobs and money. The things some people considered a question. If you read stuff like that all your life, it would make you hate Russia. Cappadocia was famous, but it was hard to tell what it was, even from photographs. The photographs often showed an unnatural number of hot-air balloons, maybe fifty hot-air balloons, suspended at various heights over what was generally described as a surreal moonscape or a fairytale landscape. I thought there had to be some relationship between the hot-air balloons and the moonscape, but it seemed there wasnt. Someone had just decided that a balloon was the easiest way to see everything. Cappadocia was the ancient name for a region that now extended into three or four modern Turkish provinces, each with its own city. The whole region was on a high volcanic plateau that had been eroded into ridges, valleys, pinnacles, and weird formations, including fairy chimneys. Fairy chimneys sounded ethereal, but were actually massive stone pillars or cones, hundreds of feet tall, each with a huge boulder perched on top. The wind sculpted them that way. When I was little, my mother and aunt had tried to describe the fairy chimneys to me. My mother had eventually said that the thing a fairy chimney most resembled was a penis. Very true, my aunt had said, nodding judiciously. At that time I had never seen a penis. In many places, the rock formations were riddled with holes: portals to thousands of dwellings, churches, and monasteries that had been carved there by ancient people. It was another confusing thing about Cappadocia: the sculpted-looking rocks had gotten that way through erosion; the holes, which looked like the result of some obscure natural process, werentunless you counted ancient people hiding to be a natural process. In some places, they had carved out whole interconnected villages: multilevel cities that accommodated up to ten thousand people, with stables for horses. People had been hiding in Cappadocia since the fourth century BC. Early Christians had hidden there from the RomansPeter wrote about them in the Bible. Today, Cappadocia was a famous tourist destination. Nobody thought it was weird or dangerous for me to go there, so I wasnt followed. I got a room in a pension in a 150-year-old Greek Ottoman mansion. The proprietor, a middle-aged woman with a cool haircut, showed me to a huge room overlooking a rose garden. I had noticed, with surprise, that I was often received warmly at pensions. In restaurants, they were sorry that you werent more people, or a man, but pensions were different. Welcome, welcome, welcome, said one proprietor, using a lot of different phrases that meant welcome. Youre very welcome here. He seemed barely able to contain his excitement, and finally said, in a confiding tone: A lady traveling by herself is our favorite customer. Really? Why? Ladies never break anything. Do other people... break things? Of course they do. Men, families. Immediately something gets broken. The property value decreases. What do they break? I asked, feeling worried. His pension was starting to sound kind of fragile. What dont they break. They break the windows. They smash through the walls. Things you wouldnt even imagine. Whereas a nice, well-brought-up ladyhe inclined his head deferentiallycan stay ten years in a room and it looks exactly the same as when she came there! The property value doesnt change at all! I felt relieved, because I was sure I would manage not to break the windows, and it was pleasant to receive what was clearly intended as a compliment. At the same time, there was something disquieting in the image of a well-brought-up lady staying ten years in a room without leaving a visible trace. Then I was in the intercity bus station trying to figure out how to get a local bus to Ahmetpaa, a village that Sean had told me to visit, because it supposedly had some undervalued ancient grottoes. The guys who worked for the intercity bus lines stared at me like I was insane. Some of them told me with an aggrieved expression about the many tourist bus companies that would take me to see far more interesting and famous sites. I have to go to Ahmetpaa, I kept saying. I work for a book. This had been going on for ten minutes when a station employee said, in a cheerful tone: Ahmetpaa? Not a problem, Ill drive you there. When are we leaving? He looked to be in his twenties, with a lively expression. I couldnt tell if he was jokingnot that it mattered, since I had to take the bus. That was the only reason they gave jobs like this to students with no skills: because if someone said to ride a night bus for seventeen hours while eating a tripe sandwich, we would do it, and write down how much it cost. He said there was no bus. I objected. How else did people go to and from the village? I must have made a grammar mistake, because he immediately switched to the strident, officious-sounding English spoken by tourism workers. It was really depressing. Who had taught them to talk like that? What knowing, pedagogic haranguers were they imitating? From here, you must go two hours. You must go two buses. He held up two fingers. Splendid, I said energetically in Turkish, using one of my grandmothers favorite Ottoman words. The more torture I live through, the more beneficial. I am sorry? he said in English. This book I work for is for Americans. If their life is too easy, they worry that theyre missing the authentic essence of Turkish existence. Thats why they want to go to Ahmetpaa. Yes? He seemed to think it over. I propose it to you like this, he said in Turkish, and it was like his whole personality changed and became once again courteous and humorous. Lets say we put you on a bus to Ahmetpaa. In two hours, youll travel seven kilometers. Youll see all the things there are to see in Ahmetpaaone by one, youll see all of them. Will you see the authentic essence of Turkish existence? This I dont know, youll have to judge. Youll find its enough torture for one day. By that time, Ill be done with work, Ill come pick you up and well have dinner. What do you say? If you help me find the bus, Ill be very grateful, I said. And dinner? Well, I dont think so. But I can think about it on the bus. Terrific! He beamed, sitting back in his chair. All I want is for you to think about it. Youve made me very happy. So which is the bus to Ahmetpaa? What? Oh, right. I have no idea. Velih bey! An older man shuffled over with a cane. Yes, Mesut, he said. As you command, Mesut. You see, when Mesut calls, I come right away, in a manner of speaking, as my ability permits, and Ill tell you why that is. Its because I know some very important business is waiting for me. Other people will call you over for some nonsense, but with Mesut you never regret getting up out of your comfortable chair. Velih bey, Ive disrupted your comfort, and now youre making me bashful. Not at all, son. Tell me how its my honor to help you. Velih bey, listen! This young lady has to get to Ahmetpaa on a bus. You see, the young lady is a researcher, and theres something she has to research in Ahmetpaa, and this can only be accomplished by going there on a bus. On a bus? But there is no bus. If she changes buses... its two hours. Mesut explained about how the bus was part of the research. Velih listened closely, then called a messenger to ask a guy they knew who lived in the village next to Ahmetpaa. Another messenger was sent to bring tea. Everyone now called me miss, and acted like it was not just reasonable but also important for me to get to Ahmetpaa. A researcher! Velih said, while we waited for the messengers. How nice. You and I should do some research one of these days, Mesut told him. Very true. You and I live here all our lives and dont do research. Then from America they come and research all kinds of things. Even in Ahmetpaa, they research something. And rightly. Isnt there something to be researched, in every corner of Gods creation? Isnt that what youve found, miss, in your travels? Mesut escorted me to the local bus and told the driver to leave me at a place in the road where I could flag down the bus to Ahmetpaa. I asked the name of the place in the road, so I could write it down. The driver told me the name of a nearby creek. I copied it in my notebookso that someday other people could have the same experience as me. The second bus deposited me in a square with an Atatrk statue and a general store. There was no sign of any ancient hidden grottoes. Well, there wouldnt be, would there? But when I went into the store to buy a cherry juice, the storekeeper asked if I had come to see the churches, and called a boy to show me the way. The boy, who seemed used to being ordered around, set off at once in a businesslike manner, walking quickly, and then more quickly, until we were basically jogging. I gradually understood that the reason we were walking so fast was to outpace two fornicating dogs, who were somehow following us. They would go at it for a few seconds, and then stagger along after us, and then start again. Are those your dogs? the boy asked finally. When I said they werent, he threw a rock at them, and they ran away, with embarrassed expressions. When we got back from the grottoes, the guy from the bus station, Mesut, was standing in front of the Atatrk monument, by a parked white Opelthe same model that Ivans mother drove. His face lit up. Selin! You took too much trouble, I said. It hadnt occurred to me that he would be able to find me so easily. I told him I had been planning to take the bus. The minute I said that, it sounded absurd. The idea of taking the bus was to assert ones independence, and to not get into a car with a strange man. But wasnt one dependent on the buswasnt the bus full of men? I got in the car. We drove half an hour to a city I had thought of as being far away, because it took forever to get there by bus. The sun set and the moon rose. Mesut parked on a side street behind a restaurant. I hadnt really looked at him before, but I was able to watch him as he was exchanging greetings with like every single person who worked in the restaurant. I saw that he was shorter than me, and somehow looked more alive than everyone else. We sat on the roof under a grape arbor. Tavern-style Ottoman music was playing. Mesut ordered two glasses of wine, took out a pack of cigarettes, offered me one, smoked half a cigarette, then said cigarettes were bad for the health and threw his out. He didnt drink most of his wine, either. So, Selin, he said. Tell me. What should I tell you? About your researches. I told him about the grottoes, about the boy who had shown me around. We had walked four kilometers and climbed up and down rocks. The boy had known all the easiest places to climb, and had held my hand at a difficult point, and told me what he said were the names and ages of all the churches, though I wasnt convinced he had the Greek names quite right. I hadnt known whether to give him money afterward and had tried to buy him cookies, but he had said he had to go home for dinner. He was a good kid, Mesut said. He did well. He could tell you were a good person, too. Good people always find each other. Was that true? It was too bad there wasnt a club you could join, the way there were for different religions, ethnicities, and nationalities, all of which comprised both assholes and non-assholes. How evenly they seemed to be distributed. What was it based on? Everything was deliciousthe salad with sumac, the fresh bread, the harsh wine. Now, you tell me, I said. What shall I tell you? He sat up straighter. About your childhood. My childhood passed very happily on the Black Sea, he said immediately. His mother had died when he was a baby, so he didnt remember her and had never been sad. The closest person to him, his older sister, Elmas, was now married to a wonderful man, so he never saw her or talked to her anymore. His favorite thing to do as a child had been catching fish, with his hands: thats how many fish there had been then. He used to put them in a bucket and sell them. It seemed to me that Mesuts life was more real than mine, though how could anyones life be any more real than anyone elses? I said I had to go back to the pension, to write up the days copy. He proposed a scenic route back. I said OK. After two weeks of local buses that stopped every twenty feet to pick someone up, it was pleasant to move so freely, without a giant slow bus-butt dragging behind us. The steep road ended suddenly at a precipice. Spread out beneath us were fairy chimneys like giant creatures gathered in the moonlight. What would this place have looked like, then? Where were we, what did everything mean, why was it like this? His bearing, when he kissed me, was daring and deferentiallike he wanted to see how far he could get through charm and diplomacy. His heartbeat: was I feeling it or hearing it? In Turkish, you could hear a smell. Why did aftershave always feel like it was hacking your brain? What a beautiful girl you are, he said, with a kind of ache or awe in his voice, that made me think about how someday I would be old or dead or both, and the transience of all things, of the car, the moonlight, the volcanic rock that was eroding and the stars that were shooting by, made the world seem at once more important and less important, until finally the concept of important itself faded away like an expiring firework that glittered against the sky. He reclined my seat and started to climb over the gearshift box. No, dont do that, I said. Why? I dont want to. Why? Because I dont. Why? It would be really nice with you. I can tell, he said. I could tell when I saw you in the bus station. (What?) No, impossible. But why? I hadnt initially considered why as an actual question but, as the exchange dragged on, I turned it over in my mind. Wasnt it that thing related to self-worth? I thought of an episode of Sex and the City, when Samantha got stood up in a restaurant, by a real-estate tycoon, and started crying, right in front of the Pakistani busboy. Carrie called him that in the voice-over, though he looked to be in his forties. At the coat check, the Pakistani busboy kissed SamanthaSamantha let the Pakistani busboy kiss her; after all, hed been so sweet and attentive with the breadand suggested they leave together. Samantha hesitated, then recovered her self-respect just in time to give him a big tip and leave with her head held high. Yes, that was it: you were supposed to remember that you were better than him. But why were you supposed to be better than him? I just dont, I said, and I heard my voice break. Dont worry about it, Mesut said promptly. Lets do something else. Why dont we go to the thermal springs? At the thermal springs, as at the restaurant, Mesut seemed to enjoy a large acquaintance. A guy showed us to a steam-clouded yellow stone room with a rectangular pool. Wearing only our underwear, we lowered ourselves into the warm water, which was metallic and sulfurous and felt unusually buoyant. We kissed for a long time. Eventually, when he pushed aside my underwear and slid his fingers in, I felt a jolt that seemed to promise something. It felt like a message coming through a wall. It felt like an important lead in the case. His erection looked different from the Countsits expression was somehow more optimistic and alert. It occurred to me that the Count might not have been circumcised. But what even was circumcision? Of course I knew that it was the cutting off of the foreskin, which was a flap of skin. But even when you knew that, how much did you really know? I was scared at first that everything would be just the same as the first time, and we would mess up the bed in the hotel run by Mesuts friend, which was where we had ended up. Then it seemed to go in really easily, so I thought maybe it had already happened and I wouldnt have any more problems. Later, though, it turned out that it hadnt been in all the way, and it became like the first time. So nothing had changed. Its OK, we can stop here, Mesut said, and went back to where it didnt hurt. He stroked my hair, told me my body was even more beautiful than he had imagined. Then, after a while, he started pushing again. With the Count, I had thought that that repetitive motion was related to how it was my first time: that it was about breaking through something and, once he got through, that would be when we would do whatever it was that sex was. Now, I was starting to get the feeling that the in-and-out motion was sexthat there wasnt anything else after that. I mentally reviewed the sex scenes I had seen in movies. Either the people were comically bouncing, or, if it was serious, they were slowly rising and falling. When someone was being raped, you just saw the mans jabbing butt. OK: now I knew what was happening on the other side. It was him poking it in and taking it out, over and over. Thats what sex was. I tried to assimilate this new informationto accord it its correct importance. Later, he dropped me off at the pension. I walked through the moonlit garden, went up the stone staircase, took a shower, and wrote copy until I fell asleep, with the feeling of leading a full life. After the first five or six times, it barely hurt anymore. But then at some point, when we were talking, I laughed at something implausible-soundingBut how could that possibly be!and, out of real or simulated anger, he pushed in deeper, and the blinding jolt made me realize that before that he had been going gently, and the thought made my soul feel like it was opening wider. It did start to feel less pointless, the more you did it. The point wasnt what I had thought it was going to be; it didnt immediately resolve or answer any preexisting need or question on my part. It didnt automatically make sense, as I had expected, given its universal and canonical status. It was, rather, its own super-specific thing, like the taste of some particular kind of wine. The moments, isolated at first, when I started to feel like I understood itlike I understood why it was desirable, how to appreciate it, and how to draw it outreminded me of the first time I managed to follow a Shakespeare play, and understood not only what all those people were talking about, but why their mode of speech was considered admirable. How all the things that went unspoken in a real conversationbecause they were secret, or because nobody had realized them, or put them into wordshad been translated into a measured multi-syllabic torrent that unfurled so ceaselessly from the actors. Yes: understanding the point of sex felt just like understanding the point of Shakespeare. And werent the two related? The animus I had previously felt... not toward Shakespeare himselfwhat had he ever done except write some plays?but toward the story that was told about his universal humanity, its virtuosic expression through earthy ribald wordplay, such that Shakespeare said nothing and meant a vagina, or said O and meant a vagina, or said country matters and meant a vagina. Sometimes, when I caught that glimmer of promise, I tried to touch myself to see if I could have an orgasm. It never quite worked. Afterward, when Mesut had gone into that weird trance, I wondered if I should get up and go to the bathroom and try to do it by myself in peace. But it always felt like more hassle than it was worth. I concluded that having an orgasm must not have been the point, and that not having had one wasnt the reason for the vague unsatisfied feeling I had sometimes. The reason must have been something else. I moved from the pension to Mesuts friends hotel. Mesuts friend had overgrown curly hair, bushy eyebrows, and a comically perplexed expression, like he didnt understand why or how he had ended up running this hotel, which had so much beige carpeting and, on top of everything else, beetles. The beetles were extraordinarily shiny, large, and black, with a slow, wobbly gait. I never saw such beetles anywhere else, either before or after. Mesut didnt like to be seen leaving in the morning, so at sunrise he jumped out the window into some bushes. When I told my mother how Mesut jumped out the window, she said he was married. I said I didnt see how that was possible. Im positive, she said. Are you married? I asked Mesut later. What? He started to laugh. How could I be married? When are you going to get married? He laughed again and didnt say anything. You and I will get married someday, he said finally. Why did I feel a wave of elation? It was like my brain knew to strive toward freedom, but my body had another plan. Or was the elation the part that was real, while the rest of itthe idea that you couldnt get married before you finished college, that you had to marry someone who had been to college and spoke Englishwas somehow fake? I could tell Mesut was smart, because he wasnt always repeating himself, and he always understood what I was trying to say, even when I didnt know the right words. Once, when one of the guys at the bus station expressed skepticism about my knowledge of the provinces around Ankara, Mesut laughed and said: You should believe her, she knows. He said it in such a funny way that everyone laughed, and nobody was offended. I got lost for two hours in the Valley of Love. At first it seemed impossible to believe that the rock formations were naturally shaped that way. Then again, actual penises were shaped like that, so maybe that was just natures MO. I climbed up a steep slope, thinking it was the way out, and then I was too scared to climb back down. Far above me, on a different plane of existence, like in a Dutch painting, a man with a donkey was walking along the edge of an orchard. The man waved. I waved back. The giant Ericsson phone in my bag started to ring. It was my great-aunt Bahriye. Who is this? she demanded, though she was the one who had called. Hello, Auntie Bahriye, this is Selin. Who? Selin? The gardeners daughter? She sounded outraged. It took a long time for me to explain who I was. She said that the gardeners daughter, Selin, was only eight years old, but always getting into things that werent her business, so it would have been just like her to figure out how to make phone calls. Eventually, a German couple with hiking gear helped me out of the valley. The girl held my hand. Afterward I tried to buy them lunch at a restaurant that I liked, but they paid for my lunch when I wasnt looking. I went to a caf to revise the days pages. Take a left on the dirt road at the onyx factory, walk about 400m, descend on the right... The directions hadnt worked for me, but was that the fault of the directions? Did I have a better suggestion? Mesut turned out to be religious. He kept asking about my relationship with Islam. I said it was respectful but distant. He gave me an illustrated booklet for women, about how to do ritual ablutions, and demonstrated how to wash your ears. I had a headscarf that I carried in my daypack, for going to holy sites. Mesut asked to see what it looked like. Not like that, he said, and then he tied it himself much more expertly, wrapping and tucking the ends several times, so that it covered all my hair and also the lower part of my face. Wow, this is great! I said, turning in front of the mirror. I looked like a different person. Im just going to go around like this from now on. Mesut looked uneasy. Take that thing off, he said. One night, Mesut spoke to me shortly. At the thought of how differently he had spoken to me such a short time ago, I felt so desolate that I thought it must surely be wrong for me to stay there in that hotel. I packed my daypack with clothes for two days and took a four-hour bus ride to a town near a valley where you could hike to see some more thousand-year-old underground frescoes. I checked into a hostel, left my bag, and set out for the trailhead. The cell phone started to ring. When I told Mesut where I was, and said I was spending the night, his voice changed, he said he would come and get me after work. But its four hours away, I said. What? No its not, in a car its barely an hour. It wasnt dark yet when he came. He said he had never been to this town before. So show me whats here, he said. And I showed him. Mesut said it was only important to wear a condom at the end. I told him this wasnt true, but I couldnt tell if he believed me. Once, in the middle, he said he had taken the condom off when I wasnt looking. How could you! I said, pushing him away, and burst into tears. How upset you are, he said, in a voice of wonder, and showed me that he had been joking. Later, I found a package insert in the Durex box, written in polite Turkish: Entering a vagina without wearing a condom must not be done. Entering the vagina, even before orgasm, may be a cause of pregnancy. I cut out that part of the insert, together with an illustrative diagram, and made a collage inside a greeting card with an Ottoman miniature on the front. The miniature showed a world with many levels and balconies and terraces, among which men with doll-like faces and pillowy bodies were kneeling under a starry sky. When Mesut opened the card, I was worried for a moment that he was offended, but then he burst out laughing and said that I was an awake one, and that he would keep this card always as a reminder. Once, because I felt grateful and because I didnt want to make any mistakes, I tried to give him a blow job. What are you doing! Mesut exclaimed. He said it was unclean and made me swear that I would never ever do anything like that again with anyone for the rest of my life. OK, I promise, I said finally. He made me promise never to do anal, either. I wondered whether those things were considered worse than having sex when you werent married. Pubic hair, it turned out, was also un-Muslim. There was a hadith about it. The subject seemed to make Mesut really anxious. His feelings were so much stronger than mine that one day, in the shower, I shaved everything off. Had anything I had ever done in my whole life delighted anyone so much as that one act of depilation delighted Mesut? So what do you think about love? I asked Mesut in a casual tone. Love is to get caught on something, he said readily. Its to be unable to forget. I postponed my departure date a couple of times. Mesut said he would put me on the best bus: a Mercedes. On the way to the station, Mesut said how lucky he was to have met someone like me, to have spent this time together. He printed my ticket at the counter. Outside, dusk was falling. Only one bus was lit up. Mesut greeted the driver and porters, and stowed my backpack under the bus. How present and alive he was, how strong and substantial. Yet this was itself a form of limitation. An inextricable aspect of his strength and solidity was that he existed, not everywhere, but in a particular place. Unlike my feelings, which were dimensionless and followed me wherever I went, he was person-sized and staying here. The heavy gears creaked into motion behind my eyes and in my chest. I felt just like I had for the whole fall. I couldnt imagine how I had lived like that. At the same time, I felt lucky to feel it againto be here again. It was as if some portal had swung open. Weeping, a powerful physical process that was normally out of the question, became a constant possibility. This seemed to prove the material reality of thoughts and feelings. Mesut got on the bus with me. I had a row of seats to myself, at the front, so I could see out the giant windshield. You could see a lot, because the bus was so high up. Mesut gave me a gift-wrapped packet and said to open it later, and touched my face to brush away a tear, and it was unbearable that he was being so kind, and that this moment was already compromised by being the last one, and presenting so few possibilities. Now he was conveying good wishes to people in my family and saying complimentary things about Adana. More time passed. Eventually, he turned and went down the steps, and the doors closed behind him, and all the people around me were strangers. The driver watched me in the mirror, and said I was clearly a good person to be so sad. I must have really liked Mesut, and it was true that Mesut was a good kid, but now I had nothing to worry about because he, the driver, knew what he was doing, and the trip to Adana would be so smooth and devoid of incident that we would be there before I had time to be uncomfortable. I opened the gift Mesut had given me. It was a cassette. I put it in my Walkman, worried that it would be the kind of despairing arabesque music that Mesut liked to listen to. But it was upbeat Americanized pop music, with a drum machine that sounded like Turkish hand drums, and synthesizers that sounded like a lute, and the first song was called This Girl Will Be the Death of Me. It was a comical song. Tears streamed down my face. Why this intensity of griefalmost worse than it had been with Ivan? Was it because I hadnt known, with Ivan, that I was seeing him for the last time, and had still believed in a future where things would go back to how they had been? Certainly I didnt think that now. How would I ever be back in Cappadocia, why? Mesut had promised to visit me, but the possibility seemed unlikely, and not entirely appealing. We would have to deal with all his ideas about America, and his way of speaking English, and what would we even do: eat Thai-style chicken wraps at The Wrap? I tried to remember the insulting name of the Thai-style chicken wrap. The name was Thai Me Up. I felt my face contort with sorrow. I would never again climb into Mesuts white Opel, we would never drive around the phallogocentric columns in which Byzantine people had hidden, we wouldnt drink astringent wine on that roof, or go to the hotel and have sex for hours. Was that what was so painful: that nobody had ever come so close to menobody had ever seen me, and come right up to me, and kept going, and looked into my eyes so seriously, with so little fear? July In Adana, I was immediately absorbed into my family. It was important for me to meet every powerful man we knew. They werent actually so numerous, but each meeting seemed to last forever. Lackeys brought tea. The powerful men kept jocularly threatening to make someone make you a Turkish coffee, using the potentially infinitive verb construction that also existed in Finnish. At some point, they tried to mention all the old people in your family by name. My cousin Evren was on summer break from medical school in Istanbul. She had gotten in a year early. Now that she had left Adana and was studying at a famous and beautiful university, she seemed more relaxed than before, and I felt less guilty. When I had visited Adana as a child, I had spent every day with Evren. Evren was always at our grandparents house, because her fathermy aunts husbanddrank, and had once thrown my aunt down the stairs when she was pregnant. At the playground, Evren always wanted me to tell the other children, the boys, that I was from America. It was never something I felt like doing: hunting down strange boys, to tell them about America. Wasnt that what I had earned, by always being different in America: the right to be the same, here? But what had Evren earned by being the one whose parents werent doctors in America? When the boys said they didnt believe me, Evren would get angry. The boys seemed to expect this, and to be surprised that I wasnt angry. We dont believe you, they kept saying, as if waiting for me to freak out. Evren and I had never taken a trip together just the two of us, and it was exciting to be headed to North Cyprus. We took a four-hour bus ride to the port where the ferries departed, but that was as far as we got, because it turned out you needed government ID to get on the boat. My passport was in Ankara, and I had only student ID and my faceless citizenship card. We made some calls from my giant cell phone. An intervention was effected by one of the powerful men I had drunk tea with. After that, everyone was really polite to us. I was allowed on the boat, though Evren wasntbecause she hadnt brought any ID at all. We were both crying. Evren wanted me to go back to Adana with her, but I was already two days behind in my itinerary. Feeling the traitorousness and guilt that had so rarely left me since Evren and I were children, I got on the boat alone. I wasnt entirely surprised when, four hours later, arriving in Kyrenia with my faceless ID, I was promptly hustled back onto the boat and sent back to Turkey. Clearly, I was going to live the rest of my life like that, going back and forth. But the Turkish customs officers seemed to take it as a personal affront to them that I hadnt been admitted into Cyprus. They printed me a special pass and said that if I hurried I could get the last boat back. The ferry wasnt actually running anymore, but some of the crew were heading back for the night. The hatchet-faced captain, who hadnt previously addressed me or acknowledged me in any way, said that I could sit with him on the upper deck. I wasnt sure that I wanted to sit with him, but it was clear from how everyone else acted that this was a great privilege. In the glass-enclosed cabin with the steering apparatus, I was shown to a leather command chair next to the captains, high above the sea that unfurled before us like some magical shimmering fabric. The sun was sinking into the horizon, and gold and purple seemed to pour infinitely out of the clouds. The taxi driver who took me to the old harbor told me the story of his life, and started to cry. He had been evacuated from the south, with all the ethnic Turks, when the island was partitioned in 1974. He swore that the north was a shithole, the places he had left were ten times more beautiful, with trees and flowers that didnt exist here. Was that possible? The south was literally a fifteen-minute drive away, and it was hard to imagine anywhere more beautiful than this. At Lets Go, the fact that you couldnt travel between North and South Cyprus was spoken of with humor. It was part of the aura of provincial quaintness that surrounded so many of other countries problems, especially those related to ancient ethnic conflicts. Americas position, moderating between these groups of unreasonable people, was inherently comical. Like: the Turks and the Greeks hated each other, yet both were NATO allies. What a funny, delicate position for America! The Kurdish conflict was taken more seriously, maybe because Kurdish people had militant separatists who did suicide bombings, not just in Turkey but sometimes in Western Europe. Why were there so many such people: people who preferred to kill themselves and others, rather than just join some country? In some cases, it seemed like the country itself was keeping them out. Other times, it seemed like the separatists just didnt want to join. I found myself remembering one of the final projects that someone had made in Constructed Worlds class last year: a wooden box full of garbagea broken piece of ornamental ironwork, a stained green satin square, an old wooden pen with a rusty nibaccompanied by a short story. The story was about a little girl who lived in a fantastic realm and who had to mine some kind of ore all day, and whose mother often told her: Our people were not always slaves. One day, the girl challenged her mother. The mothers eyes flashed with rage. She wordlessly went to a closet, took down a wooden box, and removed, one by one, the priceless artifacts of her people: the curiously molded amulet, the scrap from the princesss dress that had been used to tie the heros wound, the rusted pen that had signed the treaty that had been violated. If the little girl ever forgot those things, then she would have helped to murder her ancestors. I knew that Leora believed something like that, and thought she had to learn her ancestors languages, translate their books, and memorialize how they had been murdered. But Atatrk said: There are many countries, but there is only one civilization. For a nation to progress, it needs to join in this one and only civilization. If that was true, then you werent betraying your ancestors just by speaking whatever language published the most books, and trying to write new books that were different from the old ones. When my mother was six and found out about Englandabout the existence of Englandshe said she wished she had been born in England, and my grandfather flew into a terrifying rage: the kind he didnt have anymore by the time I was born, because of his heart. All over Turkey there were painted signs that said, how happy is the one who says i am a turk: another quote from Atatrk. If my grandfather had been happy to be a Turk, why had he shouted at my mother? On my weekly phone call with Sean, I tried to ask about separatists. Sean let out a bark of laughter. Above my pay grade! Well, I was getting paid even less than he was. After Antakya, which turned out to be the same thing as Antioch, I started working my way back west along the Mediterranean. Now it was no longer government officials but, rather, pension owners who met me at the bus station. Addressing me by name, they vied to grab my backpack, hustle me into their cars, and shout about the tourism sector. These encounters were stressful and disconcerting. Still, if I had to choose, I preferred the hoteliers to their counterparts in the government or the army. At least the hotel people thought my job was real. They had heard of Lets Go and thought it was important. They didnt, of course, believe in it in the same way that Lets Go itself didin our objectivity. They thought I could write whatever I wanted, and withhold or grant infinite business according to my caprices. The idea of an allegiance to the reader made no sense to them. What difference was it to the foreigners what hotel they stayed in? The other hotel had a better breakfast? But the reason it had a better breakfast was because more people stayed there, so they could buy more different kinds of cheese, and could make eggs to order, instead of just boiling them. If more people came here then we would have a big fresh breakfast here every day, too, with even more things! (Then they would list all the things they would have for breakfast.) So now will you write it in the book? At first, it seemed to me that I had been deposited into an easily resolved misunderstanding, one I could help straighten out, because of my conversance with different cultures. I saw, for example, that the Turkish word turistik had a positive connotation, implying things that Turkish people valued, like air-conditioning and an international clientele. I was excited, at first, to tell some of the sadder and more intellectual-seeming hostel ownersto explain that the particular kind of tourists who used books like Lets Go didnt like the word tourist. But the only thing these explanations conveyed was my good-heartedness and possible willingness to have sex with them. I eventually gave up trying to explain anything to anyone. It did no good. Everyone was too afraid. The Turkish people were afraid of missing some opportunity represented by the tourists, of being taken advantage of and left with nothing. The tourists were afraid of missing some authentic experience, of being exploited for their money and left with nothing. What the tourists really wanted was never to pay for anything, because they were good people. I had noticed this in myself: how I always hoped to be given things for free, as a reward for not being a total asshole. It was, I saw, a specious hope, one I would potentially outgrow when I was older and had more money. But Lets Go acted like not paying for things wasnt just advantageous, but noble. Conversely, to pay the tourist price wasnt just to lose money, but to capitulate to panderers: to fail to support the truly deserving and authentic. The way you supported the deserving and authentic was apparently by paying them less. How much of not wanting to be a tourist came down to stinginess? At some point, Lets Go pointed out that you could bypass the swarms of tourists that crammed Istanbul and the beaches, by not going to Istanbul or the beach; instead you could backpack around small villages, enjoying countless cups of ay offered by people who take pride in their tradition of hospitality. I thought it looked stupid when they put ay in italics, as if there wasnt an exact synonym: tea. More to the point, what was so great about that tea? Why was it necessarily better than the burnt coffee at Au Bon Pain? Because it was free? Lets Go said to avoid restaurants that had a view, because they served overpriced, overrated foodbut what did overpriced even mean? A building with a view cost more to rent, so didnt the food there actually cost more? My mother wouldnt want to pay less to go somewhere without a view. It always felt like Lets Go was criticizing my mother. They kept telling you to go to cheap dives. But the cheap dives were often full of poor and unhappy men, who tried to compensate for their lack of power by dominating women. Was I shallow and elitist for wanting to avoid them? Whenever anything made me feel badly, my standard procedure was to recount it to myself as a story in which everyone was at least a little bit right, and some people were kind or humorous, and their kindness and humor redeemed everything, and recognizing it redeemed me. Then I felt humane and objective. But was I humane and objective? What if I was being like Lets Go, when they acted as if everyone elses problems were comical and sectarianlike an English novel, where the guy who had been to Eton was always finding himself in a dashed fix? It was as if even trying to narrate all the different sides put you more on the side of Lets Go and of English novelsbecause they were the ones who thought about narrating the different sides and being objective. It made me remember the last chapter of Either/Or: The Edifying in the Thought That Against God We Are Always in the Wrong. In relation to travel, too, I felt, we were always in the wrong. On the roof of the hostel in Side, a German girl, having heard me speak Turkish, demanded to see me belly dance. Im from New Jersey, I said. Oh, forget it then, she said, turning her back as fast as she could, like it might have been contagious. I was sitting on the roof drinking wine and working on copy, trying to make everything sound magical and inexpensiveand a gray puppy frolicked up to me. I hadnt paid it anything. The tears that were closer to me now, because of Mesut, filled my eyes. The puppy turned out to pertain to a vacationing Turkish family. Whats its name? I asked. Everyone started laughing: the puppys name was a mildly sexual double entendre. The father of the family, a retired schoolteacher, had twinkling eyes and a kind expression. He spoke politely, asking about my work and all the things I had seen, and I felt relief, because I knew he wouldnt ask me to belly dance or to write about his friends hotel. But, the next evening, when I went to the roof, the father was there alone, and asked me a lot of questions about my sex life, and whether I had sex with Christians, and the next day he gave me a typed report to give to the American government, about how the murder of the Armenians hadnt been centrally coordinated, and shouldnt count as a genocide. Then I was sitting in a parked bus in the bus station, looking out the open window. Outside the next bus, a white-haired man in safari clothes was thronged by young Turkish guys. Please. Please. Hello. They seemed friendly, and desirous of helping the man with his luggage, but there was something scary about their mechanical pronunciation of pleaselike it wasnt language, but just a sound you repeated, to get money. The white-haired man, who had an English accent and bore a distant resemblance to my ethics professor, spoke politely at first, but seemed to be getting anxious. One of the younger men slapped him jovially on the back, as if to imply what a good time they were all having. Please dont touch me, the English man said, several times, but the younger men didnt pay attention, they kept rollicking around him. I felt sorry and called in Turkish, He doesnt want help, he says not to touch him. One of the men turned to me with a chilling look of contempt. We speak English, too, he said. Then they all left off persecuting the English man and started calling to me, in horribly accented English, Can I touch you? and, in Turkish, other, worse things, and I realized that they hated me. Because I spoke with an accent, because I was taking the part of the foreign man, because I was interfering in their attempt to get money, because I myself had enough money to come to another country, and because I was a girl. When I looked back at the white-haired man, who was now fussing over his suitcase, I felt I had misjudged his expression. He didnt look professorial or educated. He looked like another dumb, unkind, greedy person, trying to get away with something. In Anamur, Turkeys principal area of banana production, a tall, intense-looking hostel worker offered to drive me to the ancient city of Anemurium. It was on a deserted beach. When we got there, he wanted to have sex. Why did this keep happening? It was weird that there were only two options: yes or no. Which was active, which was passive? What would I want to happen in a book? What was it that it said in that one particular book? Only connect? I was stuck with that guy for days. His name was Volkan. He left the hostel and followed me to the next town, acting like my boyfriend. It was easier, in some ways, to have a guy with you. Interactions with other people tended to go more smoothly. And yet, nearly everything the guy himself said was insane. We drank wine, smoked cigarettes, and had screaming arguments in the street. It felt somehow important and universal to be arguing in such a way with a man. Do you think Im a difficult person to get along with? Volkan asked once. Yes, I said. What about me? I had only asked out of a sense of fairness, but to my surprise, he thought about it and said: No, not really, youre easier than most people. I offered to pay for the buses and taxis, but Volkan insisted that we hitchhike. He flagged down a car, hustled me in, and told the driver that we were both students at Harvard University. The driver glanced at us in the rearview mirror and didnt say anything. Afterward, Volkan yelled at me for half an hour because he said the driver hadnt believed him. It was my fault for not having said: Yes, we met at Harvard University. At least now I had tried hitchhiking. I tried not to betray the bottomless insecurity and dread I felt when Volkan had trouble maintaining an erection. Im not a machine! he shouted. Volkan didnt like it if I touched myself while we were having sex. Why dont you just have sex by yourself then! he shouted. Volkan was constantly talking about anal sex: about how much more pleasurable it was for women, and how they loved it more than vaginal sex. Sometimes he said this in English, in the pedagogic tourism voice, mispronouncing vagina. When I told him the right way to say it, he continued to say it wrong, and said, This is how I say it. Finally, to shut him up, I said we could do anal sex. He used sunscreen as lubricant. When I told him it burned, he almost died laughing. He didnt want to stop, but then I kicked him. Once, when we were walking somewhere, a shoeshine boy looked at us. For the next half hour, Volkan kept asking which of us I thought the boy had been looking at: him or me. Volkan talked a lot about gay people. He said he had been raped as a teenager by a German archaeologist. I wondered if that was true. Who could know? Wasnt that what Rashomon was about: how you could never know if a person had actually been raped? Your hand is so soft, Volkan said, its obvious it has only ever held a pen. I felt annoyed. Who was he all of a sudden: a coal miner? Your hand is also soft, I said. Really? He seemed pleased. At dinner, Volkan told me about a girl he knew who had sex with a fire hydrant. Is that so, I said. Then he laughed for five minutes at how gullible I was, because I hadnt shouted at him that he was lying. On the one hand, I wasnt bored, and we were having sex every day. It was a relief to feel that I wasnt leading a sterile, life-denying existence, only learning the things that were in books, ignorant of the real world. My complexion looked better than it had at school. But after three days, it was too much; I realized I would rather be sterile and have dull skin and live in peace. In the afternoon, when Volkan fell asleep, I packed my bag, locked him in the hotel room from the outside, and went to the bus station. My heart was pounding. I tried to act like nothing was out of the ordinary. There was only one guy on duty at the station. He had seen me with Volkan, and had joked around with Volkan, and when I said I needed one bus ticket, not two, he just laughed and wouldnt sell me a ticket, or say anything else, or acknowledge anything I said. I went back to the hotel, unlocked the door with the key I had hidden in a flower planter, and pretended nothing had happened. But the next morning I went back to the station and it was busier, and a different guy sold me a ticket to Konya. In Konya, I walked into one of the restaurants mentioned in Lets Go, and tried to sit down. Four men rushed to my table with looks of alarm. Miss, allow us to welcome you to the family section where you will be more comfortable, one of them said. Im not here with my family, its just me, I said. But you cant sit here! one young guy screamed. The oldest of the men stepped forward. We call it the family section, miss, but in fact its where we welcome all ladies. Ladies cant sit here? I asked, looking around and realizing that everyone else was a man. Youll see for yourself, the family room is nicer. It did have newer floors, and air-conditioning. My entrance with a phalanx of waiters produced a small sensation. The local specialty, Konya kebap, was true to its description: a chunk of oven-roasted mutton. It took Volkan less than twenty-four hours to show up in Konya. The woman at the hotel desk had said it would be OK for a friend to join me, but she took one look at Volkan and started screaming. She had assumed that my friend was a lady. She hadnt expected something like this from me. Her eyes filled with tears and her voice shook. I apologized, explaining that I hadnt meant to upset her, that Volkan would stay somewhere else, and I would leave in the morning. But she said that I was no longer welcome there even for the night. Then Volkan and I were standing in the street in the middle of the night. He said that I had been wrong to not describe him as my husband. We went to another hotel and said we were married. The guy behind the desk asked to see our citizenship cards, both of which said unmarried. Volkan gave him some extra money, and then he said we could stay one night. Now I had seen how to bribe someone. Hes leaving tomorrow anyway, I told the receptionist. In fact, the guy who was covering for Volkan at work got appendicitis, and Volkan really did have to go back to Anamur. Konya turned out to be a stop on the pilgrimage to Mecca. The main sites were all religious. The most famous one was Rumis mausoleum. Rumi had founded the Mevlevi order of dervishes, and had written lyrical ecstatic poems about mystical union, or maybe about wine. I never had been into transcendental states that defied the limits of language, or anything else that defied the limits of language. The mausoleum was crowded with pilgrims, mostly men. I wore a scarf and stood to one side. There were sixty tombs, pertaining to Rumi and his family and friends. Each dead persons status was indicated by the size of the casket, whether it had a turban, and what color the turban was. In the adjoining museum, I learned about Rumis life: how he had grown up in a religious family, become a cleric, taught in a madrasa, and lived quietly with his wife and four children. Suddenly, at age thirty-seven, he met a wandering dervish named Shams. That was the decisive moment of his life. Shams asked Rumi a question. Rumi fell on his face. Rumi answered the question, and then Shams fell on his face. Shams and Rumi became inseparable, spending every moment in a realm of pure conversation, not eating or drinking. This went on for a year and a half, annoying Rumis family and the people at the madrasa. One day, Shams disappeared. Rumi went crazy and became a poet. He listened to music and whirled around for hours. Thats why dervishes did that. Rumi tracked Shams down to Damascus and got him to come back. Shams and Rumi fell at each others feet, and no one knew who was lover and who the beloved. The whole thing started up again: the mystical discourse, and everyone freaking out. At some point in the never-ending conversation, Shams was called to the back door, and went to see who it was, and nobody ever saw him again. Rumi went searching for Shams. He made it as far as Damascus, where he had a revelation: he and Shams were the same person. All the time he had been looking for Shams, he was looking for himself. In fact, Shams was the one writing Rumis poems. From then on, Rumi signed his poems with Shamss name. It wasnt what I expected from a life of a saint. He started out conventional, religious, and law-abidingand then he became consumed by love, and was alienated from his family and community, and went mad and wrote poetry? It was like St. Augustine backward. This was somehow exciting. I went to the bookstore to read some of Rumis poems. I tried the Turkish translations first, feeling they would be somehow closer to the original. I knew that Rumi had written in Persian, but he had at least spoken Turkish. Anyway, Turkish, unlike English, had a lot of Persian words. But the only Turkish editions in the store, aside from an expensive shrink-wrapped multivolume set that would never have fit in my backpack, were flimsy booklets full of typos, where the cover art was a rainbow-colored whirling dervish, or a photograph of a dew-covered rose. I picked up an English translation: one that seemed correctly book-sized, with a professionally designed cover, an introduction, and hundreds of pages of couplets organized into different categories. In dreams, and even awake, you will hear the beloved screaming at you. Was it possible that Rumi was funny? Reading in English was so much easier and more fun, and yet I felt dissatisfied, as if I was failing to capitalize on some advantage I had from being Turkishone that would compensate for the hassle of having a name and appearance that had always required explanation. It had, I realized, been a real disappointment to get to Turkey and to discover that my name and appearance still required constant explanationmaybe even more so than in America. People heard my accent, and saw what I was wearing, and doing, and it didnt make sense, or fit with my ID card. I realized, too, that, even though I had known that Rumi had written in Persian, I had still thought that he somehow was Turkish, or also wrote in Turkish. Was that itself a part of Turkish culture: the belief that a thing was Turkish, or had some connection to Turkey, even if nobody else thought that? Turkish people thought that Turkish and Hungarian were related, but Hungarian people didnt think that. I skimmed a pamphlet published by a Turkish historical association, explaining that Rumi considered himself to be an ethnic Turk, and wrote in Persian only as a literary convention. It quoted a line from a poem: I am that Turk who does not know Persian. The pamphlet was contradicted by a book in English that had more regular formatting, included more different quotes, and pointed out that the line about not knowing Persian was itself written in Persian, and was therefore a metaphor or paradox. Rumi hadnt been attached to the idea of people being from different countries, and generally invoked Turkishness in order to destabilize it. I am a Turk one minute and a Tajik the next, he had written. And: I called you a Turk, but I did so to confuse the onlookers. I bought the English edition. The translator, Coleman Barks, was apparently from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and didnt speak Persian. Yet his book had some of the only true-seeming descriptions of spring that I had ever seen. The ground turns green. A drum begins. Commentaries on the heart arrive in seven volumes. That was clearly correct. So was this one: Spring, and no one can be still, with all the messages coming through. And I had never heard anyone describe so accurately the difference between last year and this year: Last year, I admired wines. This, Im wandering inside the red world. Sometimes, as I was reading, I felt worried that Coleman Barks had made everything up. How could a thirteenth-century person have written such things? If you want what visible reality can give, you are an employee. On the other hand, why couldnt Rumi have said that? What was the thing they didnt have back then? Visible reality? Employees? It seemed strange that Rumi had been married twice, and had children, but they hadnt been the most important people in his life. Some random guy had been more important. Did that mean he was gay, or would have been gay if it had been allowed? Or did it mean that there was some different way that I hadnt heard of for one person to be important to another? You are not the bride or the groom. You do not fit in a house with a family. Was it possible to be like thatto not be the bride or the groom, to not fit in a house with a family? What happened to you, then? Everyone said that Shams had probably been murdered, with the involvement of Rumis son. Antalya As I was staggering around the edge of the Antalya bus station, an unusually handsome young man stood up from a railing he had been leaning against. Shall I help with your bag? he said. He looked like a movie actor, like someone on an ancient vase: lithe, muscular, with high cheekbones and cropped hair that showed his elegantly shaped head and neck. The cartoon Martian on his T-shirt brought out the green of his eyes. I must have given him the backpack, because then he was carrying it, walking ahead of me in an easy loose-limbed way. I followed him to a small hostel with a weedy garden. He said it was owned by his cousin. I see youve met Koray, said the cousin, who was short and square, with military posture and an outdoor tan. Hes actually a good kid, he added, as if I had suggested otherwise. The cousin had worked for five years on a Russian ship, and knew about Pushkin. The hostel was nothing special, but it was cheap and clean, and my bag was there. Koray offered to come back in the evening and show me the nightlife. We went first to a beer garden, where Koray bought me an Efes and told me a story about a German pig. I was pretty sure I wasnt understanding him rightmaybe he was speaking some regional dialect. It sounded like the pig worked for the traffic police in Hamburg, actually directing traffic in some capacity. Koray spoke a little contemptuously of the pig, even though it sounded smart. A light shone in his eyes, now scornful, now laughing. He leaned over and kissed mea long, slow kiss. The biggest nightclub was outdoors, abutting the sea, with multiple dance floors arranged among ruins, and huge speakers that resembled missile launchers. Women were running around screaming, wearing almost no clothes. It became clear that I was supposed to pay our cover. But I dont have that, I said, laughing: it was almost forty dollars, my whole daily allowance. To my surprise, Koray seized my arm in the viselike grip of an insane person and marched me down an unlit side street, to an ATM. Get the money, he said. I didnt bring my card, I said. Dont lie to meI can tell, he said. I was so surprised that I put my ATM card into the machine and entered the PIN. The transaction menu came up in English. Oh no, my account is empty, I said. It says I wont get paid again till tomorrow. Koray leaned over and looked at the screen. It does? he said. But then how are we going to get into the club? That was when I realized he was mentallyunwell, disabled? I wasnt sure what to call it, or how to think of it. Looking back, it wasnt that there hadnt been signs. But that whole time he had been talking about the German pig, he had seemed so noble. Why had I assumed that the problem was with my Turkishthat the problem was with me? That was something girls did. On the other hand... wasnt the problem with me, by definition? After all, I was the one having the problem. Im actually really sleepy. I think Im going to go home, I said. No, youre not, he said. I wont let you. He was holding my upper arm. I thought about jerking away, or screaming, but couldnt think of how. It felt as if it required some specialized knowledge. The enormous cell phone hadnt fit in my pocket, so I had left it at the hostel. Im really sleepy, I said again. I want to go back. He looked searchingly into my face. Youre not, he said. I told you not to lie. Come on, I know a hotel. He laughed. There are beds in a hotel! Did I secretly want to have sex with him? Dora had thought she didnt want to have sex with Herr K, and hadnt it made her sick? With Koray, I had kissed him, and thought he was handsome. And I had already done it with three people, so what did one more matter? True, he might have had a mental disability. But wasnt it shallow and elitist and somehow snottily feminine to hold that against him? A guy wouldnt care about something like thatabout a girl turning out to be incapable of reasoned discourse. Why did I insist on blocking myself against the marrow of life? Wasnt thisthis, being outside, here, negotiating with a handsome, possibly disabled muggerwasnt this, the cigarette butts and melon guts in the gutter, the faint smell of horses, the sickening pulse of bass from the clubswasnt this what life was? Do you have condoms? I asked. No, dont worry, theres no need. What do you mean, theres no need? Theres no need for anything like that. I stopped walking. If we dont have condoms Im not going to a hotel, Im not going anywhere, Im going to stand right here and create a scene, I said, to my own surprise. He looked worried and annoyed. So, I was allowed to make demands. We walked up and down the streets until we found an open pharmacy. I walked in alone, past the baby formula and pacifiers, the French and German anti-aging creams. Condoms were always behind the counteryou had to ask. Once, a pharmacist had tried to upsell me ribbed condoms. Theyre more pleasurable for women, he explained, with a lewd expression. It doesnt have to be pleasurable, just let me not get sick, I shot back, quoting my grandmother, who, if you took her to a restaurant and asked her how her dish was, would say: Just let me not get poisoned. I looked through the glass door of the pharmacy onto the street. Koray was standing outside, right in front of the door. The back of his neck looked strong and innocent. The pharmacist stood up. He was heavyset, with bags under his eyes, and was wearing a white coat. I mentally composed the request for condoms, but instead the words that came out were: Is there another door? What? A back door, maybe, that I can go out. Im experiencing a problem with the person outside. The pharmacist glanced out the glass door. Thats the only door, he said, in an annoyed way that suggested that he didnt want to help methat he didnt think I deserved help. Can I use the phone, then? I want to call the police. Even as I said it, I started to feel worried about what I could possibly tell the police, but it turned out not to matter, because what the pharmacist said was: Theres no phone. It was an incredible, unforeseen degree of treachery. How can there be no phone in a pharmacy? Its broken. He said it like he didnt care if I believed himlike he wanted me not to believe him. I paid for a three-pack of condoms and left. Selamn aleykm, said the guy at the hotel, shaking Korays hand in a manly way. It was the kind of hotel Lets Go didnt write about, even though it was off the beaten path and there werent any tourists. Will the young lady be paying? he asked. It was like four dollars. Unfortunately, I dont have that, I said. I think Im going to go home. I noticed a songbird in a cage behind the desk. Was that a sign of kindness, or the opposite? Koray stood in my way. Thats for a whole night, he told the hotel guy in a petulant voice, but we only need half of one night. You must have half, the hotel guy told me. She has it, I saw it! Koray said. I gave the hotel guy the equivalent of a dollar seventy-five, and he and Koray both seemed really happy. Korays face was red and distorted and squinty, his expression no longer noble, he looked like an infant, like he was having a fit. He went through all three condomsnot by putting them on and then saying there was something wrong with them and throwing them in the toilet, like Volkan, but actually using each one, laboriously, all the way to the end. OK, give me another, he said, after he had thrown the third, sodden and heavy, onto the floor. I said there werent any, and started getting dressed. He pulled me back and said, sounding bewildered, Its as if you wont do sex anymore, now that there arent any condoms. Something shifted and it was suddenly instinctive to shove his face away with my hand, jump up, and lock myself in the bathroom. He rattled the knob and banged on the door, but not in a way that suggested he was going to break it down. I felt ashamed by how easy it had been to get away. The banging went on for a while. Someone downstairs started throwing what sounded like shoes at the ceiling. I sat on the toilet, feeling strangely calm, thinking of the engraving on the philosophy building at school: WHAT IS MAN THAT THOU ART MINDFUL OF HIM. The banging stopped, and so did the shoes. I waited a few minutes, then cracked the door open. Koray was sprawled on the bed, like he had been shot, but his chest was rising and falling in a regular, peaceful way. When I got back to the hostel, nobody was at the front desk. I went to my room, took a shower, and packed my bag, so I could leave first thing in the morning. I woke up before dawn and had to go to the bathroom. That was when I discovered that I was unable to urinate. Subsequently, it hurt to sit down, and then it also hurt if I didnt sit down. I had heard enough about urinary tract infections from my mother to wonder if I had one. When I checked my watch, it wasnt yet eleven in New Jersey, so I called her. I explained the situation. She said it was definitely a urinary tract infection. She didnt sound worried, or angry. She said that Antalya had a good hospital, that I should go straight to the ER and tell the attending physician that my parents were also physicians. He would give me a prescription, I would feel better in no time, and I should call her afterward no matter what time it was. I hung up, filled with relief. The only other people in the ER waiting room were a half-asleep woman in a headscarf, and a little boy who was lying on his stomach on a chair, repetitively snorting mucus up his nose with a hocking sound. The boy kept trying to make eye contact with me. I picked up a magazine and pretended to read an article about how to feed your baby a diet based on its horoscope, but really I was just waiting for the next hocking sound. I understood that the boy understood that I was unable to ignore him and was pleased, and was trying to snort more loudly and more particularly in my direction. When I told the doctor that my parents were also doctors, he acted like it was the greatest news he had heard in his life. He believed everything I said, didnt act like I was trying to steal medicine, didnt make me take off my clothes, wrote me a prescription, and explained how to get it filled. The whole thing cost five dollars. I couldnt believe how much easier it was than going to the student health center. When I told Korays cousin that I was checking out early, he acted like I was leaving him after twenty years of marriage. Nothing happened, my plans changed, I kept saying. Again and again, in an impassioned voice, he asked where he had gone wrong, how he could make it up to me. We went back and forth like that a few times. Did my cousin do something? he suddenly asked, taking me by surprise. Is your cousin a half-wit? I blurted, without having planned to. I didnt know how to say mentally disabled. A series of expressions passed over the cousins face. What did he do, he said. Nothing, forget it. What did he do? Nothing, my plans changed. You can talk to me. You have to talk to me. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes, Selin. Am I a half-wit? Without meaning to, I looked into his eyes. What I sawit was above my pay grade. I went out to get a taxi. August The village of Olympos was an archaeological site, so construction was prohibited, and the hostel rooms were all in treehouses or shipping containers. At Gkhans Treehouse Pension, a cute girl ran up and greeted me like I was her best friend. Now we can have a talk, she said. What are we going to talk about? I asked, smiling. My big brother. She launched into a description of how handsome her brother was and how many girlfriends he had. They were beautiful, with well-developed figures, and came from all different countries. They always wanted to see him, but he never had time, because he was the manager of the whole pension. How nice, I said. The smile with which I had been acknowledging her cuteness was still fixed on my face. Then, the brother appeared. He was wearing Terminator sunglasses and resembled a potato. What a coincidence! gushed the girl. The brother and I shook hands, after which he stepped a few feet away, apparently to organize some brochures. Dont you think my brother is the most unbelievably handsome and sexy man youve ever seen? the girl asked. The brother was standing maybe five feet away. It was like we were in a play and the convention we were observing was that he couldnt hear anything we were saying. I looked more closely at the girl, trying to figure out how old she was. Her face was radiant and transfigured, apparently at the prospect of her brothers sex appeal. You must be right, I said, which was my default Turkish response to crazy people. Youre very right worked better than You must be right, but I couldnt always bring myself to say it. There were cases where it seemed like a violation of the social contract, because didnt we both know that her brother resembled a potato? Im just going to go stop by my room, I said. Of course, of course, said the brother, breaking the fourth wall. Please make yourself comfortable. Ill be waiting here. I didnt get it. Wasnt he running a hostel? What about all his girlfriends? Backpackers were everywhere, with their bandannas and wilted flowers, their two-liter soda bottles filled with tap water, their one-liter water bottles that had been turned into bongs. Some were playing volleyball, shouting and cheering in a way that seemed unrealistic. A large pasty guy in madras shorts lay in a hammock. Other people with similar physiques and clothing were lolling on low cushioned benches. I had always thought of myself as someone who didnt judge people for dressing informally. And yethow could those people wallow like that, in shorts, reading The Alchemist? I took my time climbing the ladder: one of the few occasions when I was glad to have a backpack, rather than a suitcase. The neatly made bed and folded towels, the wall hooks and the crate for you to put your bag on, all contributed to a feeling that you had everything you needed. Seen from the little window, filtered through the leaves, the scene on the ground looked less squalid. Some treehouse-related feeling of pride and seclusion, familiar from childhood, washed over me. Was it because adults didnt like to climb ladders? Maybe it was because a treehouse was a house you could have a claim to as a childbecause you had built it, or you could plausibly have built it. For once you werent in debt to an unfathomable world built by expensive machinery. The brother, Alp, looked crestfallen when I said I had to go to the beach. But I dont know how to swim, he said, or had I misheard him? But youll be back in the evening for dinner, he continued, speaking now in a smiling, conspiratorial voice. Youll see the special air we have here. How indescribably social, how lively, with genuine, sincere conversations, and high-spirited jokes and witticisms. People come here for one night, and then they stay for a week. Look, here are some Australians who have been here for three weeks! Alp, my man! The Australian guy high-fived Alp, while his girlfriend watched with amused tolerance. Alp is very social, she said to me. I resolved to stay out past dinner. I didnt have to be back until nine, to catch a minibus that took people to see the Chimaera: a perpetual flame that came out of some rocks, believed by ancient people to be the breath of an actual Chimaera. According to Lets Go, it was because of the perpetual flame that Olympos had been founded as a temple to Hephaestus, god of blacksmiths. I didnt totally get it: Didnt the flame have to be either the breath of the Chimaera, or the fire of Hephaestuss forge? How could it be both? How would I know which it was? Was I supposed to be able to tell, by looking? The sea gradated, over the course of a meter or two, from perfectly transparent to violently blue green. If you kept swimming parallel to the shore, you could see the ruins: half-excavated Roman and Byzantine arches, towering above the water, dripping with vines and magenta flowers that resembled insane gaping faces. There was a demographic bifurcation where the local-seeming guys, the ones with the deepest tan, werent swimming, and were only wading in the shallows. The people swimming seemed to be Turkish and foreign tourists. I swam out to a big flat rock where some people were sitting. A tanned guy with a missing tooth edged next to me and complimented my swimming. He said that most people didnt like swimming but he liked it. I smiled politely, avoiding eye contact. Then he put his arm around me and stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately felt guilty: Why would I allow some people to do this, and not others? Just because he was poor, and missing a tooth? It was certainly food for thought, as I slid back into the water and breaststroked away as fast as I could, which was not fast, so, when I heard the guy jump in after me, I felt sure that he would catch up. Yet, when I looked back, he was dog-paddling in such a strange, furious way that he was barely moving forward at all. How are you able to swim so fast? Are you a professional swimmer? he called, sounding dismayed. Alp sidled up to me while I was waiting for the minibus. I pretended I had forgotten something in the treehouse. This time, he followed me up and stood blocking the ladder, talking about how much we had in common. He could tell I was very intelligent. Other people cared only about external appearances, but for him intelligence was even more important. I do have to get the minibus, though, I said. Theres lots of time, theyre always running late. Do you know whats the really striking thing? Despite your intelligence, you arent cold. I can tell you have a warm hearta soft heart. Suddenly, his tongue was pressing into my mouth. Stop, what are you doing? He stared into my eyes. Who sent you here to drive me insane? I need to go to the bus. But the bus already came and left. I thought he was joking, but he wasnt; it turned out to have left five minutes ago. You did something very wrong, I said, trying to pick out the right words to express anger. You knew I had to go to the bus, and you prevented me. How could you do that? Dont be upset, its not important. Youll see the burning rock tomorrow. He grabbed my waist. I hit his hand away. Tomorrow I wont be here. I have to see it tonight, for my job. Isnt there some other way I can get there? He looked genuinely confused. Why do you want to see it so much? Its boring. Look, I can describe it to you. Theres some rocks. Between the rocks, a little flame comes out. It doesnt look like anything. There was something destabilizing about this description of the Chimaera, with its unmistakable ring of truth. A moment ago, I had thought that I really had to see it. Why? Why did anyone have to see anything? The cute girl said that I must be really grateful to her, because she had introduced me to her brother. She asked if I knew about Converse high-tops. When I said I did, she asked me to mail her a red pair in a size thirty-seven. Youre going to send them, right? Youre going to send me red Converse high-tops? Back in Antalya, I sent off my last batch of copy. I hadnt skipped anything in my itinerary, nor had I had a nervous breakdown. Failure had not, of course, been conclusively eluded. My flight to Moscow was in three days. There, I would have to locate the geneticists, whose address included, troublingly, a street number, a corpus number, a building number, and an apartment number. I would then have to persuade that journal editor, who seemed to not know what an intern was, that I was her intern. Even so, one stage in my journey had been completed, without dishonor. On the bus, a porter was handing out tiny cakes. It was wonderful to be eating a prepackaged cake full of candied fruitan experience it would never have occurred to me to seek outwhile watching the glittering Mediterranean being shunted away behind the thick windows, replaced by the mountains and the steppe. Dusk began to fall, and I turned on my seat light and took out my new book: The Portrait of a Lady, chosen somewhat perfunctorily from the one shelf of English-language booksall discount paperback classicsat the bookstore in Antalya. It opened at an English estate, where some rich people were drinking afternoon teaI was drinking tea, too, by now, the porter had handed it outand making witty remarks. How comfortable it was to read about comfortable people! The main character showed up: Isabel, an American, somebodys niece. Everyone found her incredibly interesting, and she got to play with a cute dog.... When I looked up again, almost two hours had passed. I looked out the window. At first, all I could see was blackness, and my reflection. But when I looked more closely into my own face, I could see through it to a whole world: black mountains standing out against a glowing deep blue sky, with striated gray clouds, and stars scattered between the clouds. Some distance from the road, a long bright blue tent was lit up from inside, and near the tent was a bonfire, and I thought I could make out the shape of a horse. I couldnt believe how relevant and applicable The Portrait of a Lady was to my lifeway more so than Against Nature. The main character, Isabel, was my age, American, and lively. Only some people thought she was beautiful. The work of art she was creating was her own character: how she acted, how she was, how other people saw her. From this perspective, the aesthetic wasnt really the opposite of the ethical. The way Isabel wanted to be, and act, and seem, was generous and brave. Her main goal was to avoid meanness, jealousy, and crueltynot because God said they werent permitted, but because who even wanted to be like that? Isabels rich tubercular cousin Ralph, who was too sick to live aesthetically himself, realized that he could still have an aesthetic life just by observing Isabel. It was a great comfort to me that Ralph found Isabel as interesting as Isabel didthat Isabel wasnt the only one who found herself interesting. At some point, Henry James said that that was the only thing keeping Ralph alive: he hadnt yet seen enough of what Isabel would do. Isabel, then, was like Shahrazade, with whom I had always identified, and who used stories to postpone the moment of death. (Wasnt that what I had done, when I had written to Ivan: kept myself alive for another day?) In Isabels case, the death she postponed wasnt her own, but Ralphs, and she was living the stories, rather than narrating them. But as she lived them, they were narrated. They became the book you were reading right now. Isabels friend Henrietta showed up, wanting Isabel to marry a square-jawed American who charismatically ran his fathers cotton factory. Henrietta was blond, and said it was everyones duty to get married, and accused Isabel of acting like the heroine of an immoral novel. But Isabel didnt want to marry anyone: not the cotton guy, and not the handsome English lord who also almost immediately proposed to her. Lots of people were shocked when she rejected the lord. Isabel herself felt afraid, recognizing how she had raised the stakes. Now she had to do something even more spectacular. Ralph persuaded his dying father to leave Isabel a fortune, so she would never have to get married, and he could see what she did instead. So Isabel became rich. And then she was really scared. A large fortune meant freedom, and one had to put it to good useor what shame, what dishonor! And so one had always to be thinking. One must always be thinking, Isabel told Ralph. I am not sure its not a greater happiness to be powerless. And Ralph replied: For weak people I have no doubt its a greater happiness. It was a confirmation of my own idea of strengthof my determination to be strong. Isabels values made sense to me. She wasnt interested in ruining destitute women, or electroplating a tortoise. She wanted to fathom the human condition. She valued reading, travel, and relationships with radically different people: the kinds of people who didnt necessarily get the point of each other. At some point, Ralph asked what Isabel saw in Henrietta, and Isabel said that she liked people to be different from each other, and that, if a person struck her in a certain way, she liked them. I, too, had friends who found each other annoying and incomprehensible, and some of them really could be annoying, but they all struck me in a certain wayand that was why I liked them, that was why I loved them. Isabel said that was the supreme good fortune: to be in a better position for appreciating other people than they were for appreciating you. Thinking of the people who populated my life, who acted, spoke, and viewed the world so differentlyMesut, Juho, Lakshmi, Riley, and all the othersI recognized how important it was for me that I could understand them all, at least a little bit, and better than they could understand each other. Was that what a novel was: a plane where you could finally juxtapose all the different people, mediating between them and weighing their views? The Ankara airport felt similar to a bus station, with its tea stands and goldsmiths, and the international and domestic flights listed on the same panel. But my connecting flight was through Istanbul, with its miles of duty-free shopping and hermetically glassed-in terminals. I had checked the convertible backpack and was carrying my army surplus bag, which now contained The Portrait of a Lady, my Walkman, and a family-sized package of hazelnut wafers. I was flying Turkish Airlines. The attendants were Turkish, as were the brands of juice and mineral water. The Russian safety announcements were played from a recording. Nobody near me seemed to be paying attention. Nothing I was doing felt like a process that would end with a person being in Russia. Things werent going well for Isabel. She had ended up marrying some kind of a dilettante, to help him buy antiques. She lived in a palace, had a salon, and was unhappyjust like Tatiana at the end of Eugene Onegin. How strange that that had happened to both of them. Where had they gone wrong? But had they definitely gone wrong? Hadnt their lives been great, in a way, furnishing the plots of great books? And yet... what good had that done them? They hadnt known that their lives were actually the plot of The Portrait of a Lady or Eugene Onegin. If they had, they could have written the books themselves. Maybe that was their failure, or their misfortune: they hadnt been able to recognize and write the books. Near the beginning of The Portrait of a Lady, there was mention of an aunt who kept telling people that Isabel was writing a book. In fact, Henry James said, Isabel was not and never had been writing a book. She had no desire to be an authoress, no talent for expression, and none of the consciousness of genius, having only a general idea that people were right when they treated her as if she were rather superior. It was one of the few places where Henry James was mean about Isabel. Well, it made sense. If she could write a book, he would be out of a job. Thats why Madame Bovary had to be too dumb and banal to write Madame Bovary: so Flaubert could have a great humane moment where he said he was Madame Bovary. But I wasnt dumb or banal, and I lived in the future. Nobody was going to trick me into marrying some loser, and even if they did, I would write the goddamn book myself. Isabel, who had had the experiences, hadnt written a book; Henry James, who had written the book, hadnt had the experiences. He had had different experiences, and those, for some reason, he hadnt written about. I turned to the preface, which I had skipped at first, because it was written in the convoluted, embarrassing style that Henry James had apparently adopted in his old age. It did seem to be about what I wanted to knowabout where the book had come from. He had, he said, written it in Italy. (He didnt specify how he had gotten to Italy, and had enough time and money left to write a whole book.) The first part that had come to him had been Isabel herself: a free-floating character, with no setting, circumstances, or plot. I didnt get how you could have a person without circumstances. But apparently Turgenev had told Henry James that that was how his novels started: with the hovering vision of some person who was empty and beseeching, and the thing an artist had to do was to make up their circumstances. As for the origin of ones wind-blown germs themselves, wrote Henry Jameshe kept calling Isabel a germwho shall say, as you ask, where they come from? I felt excited, because that was what I had been asking. But he didnt really answer. First, he said, Isnt it all we can say that they come from every quarter of heaven. Then, he said, One could answer such a question beautifully, doubtless, if one could do so subtle, if not so monstrous, a thing as to write the history of the growth of ones imagination. That was exciting againespecially since he went on to say that, if you did do that subtle and monstrous thing, you would definitely find what you had been looking for. It would be there, in some circumstance of your real life. (So Isabel had come from his real life?) But it became clear that he was speaking only theoretically: in practical terms he thought that that kind of reconstruction or excavation was impossible, or somehow not worth trying, or not worth thinking about. Instead, he changed the subject to what an insignificant person Isabel was, and how weird it was that this slight personality, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl, should be endowed with the high attributes of a Subject. He marveled at how absolutely, how inordinately, the Isabel Archers, and even much smaller female fry, insist on mattering, and acted as if he was some kind of visionary for even thinking of writing a whole book about someone like that. I started to feel the combined annoyance and exhilaration that sometimes came over me on airplanes. You could tell that Henry James wasnt actually dumb, or a jerk. So how didnt he realize he was sounding like a jerk? More importantly, if the situation of a young girl whose fate wasnt decided yet was so wonderfully and paradoxically interesting, then didnt I have a big advantage by being such a person? Nowhere in the preface did Henry James say why he hadnt found his own life interesting enough to write about. I tried to remember what I knew about Henry Jamess life. I was pretty sure I had read that he was gay. Probably being gay had been illegal, and he had been ashamed. So his problem, like Isabels, was that he had been born too soon. That was sad, but it didnt really change anything. Like, for whatever reason, Henry James had had to do stuff like find a wind-blown germ and then forget how he had found it, so he wouldnt feel like he was stealing. But I was more fortunate. I was going to remember, or discover, where everything came from. I was going to do the subtle, monstrous thing where you figured out what you were doing, and why. I loved Henry James again, when he wrote about trying to dramatize Isabels life, even when there seemed to be no drama. He described a scene where the only action was that Isabel sat in a chair by a burned-out fire. In her mind she was recognizing all the machinations that had been whirling around her, remembering tiny details that she thought she had forgotten, and that now acquired new significance. Even though she never got up out of the chair and nobody else came into the room, Henry James had wanted that scene to be as interesting as the surprise of a caravan or the identification of a pirate. And it had been. All the scenes where Isabel sat in a chair and realized things were amazing. There was one line that I had copied into my notebook: Now that she was in the secret, now that she knew something that so much concerned her, and the eclipse of which had made life resemble an attempt to play whist with an imperfect pack of cards, the truth of things, their mutual relations, their meaning, and for the most part their horror, rose before her with a kind of architectural vastness. It was how I had felt when I was sitting in a dark classroom after watching The Usual Suspects, or after reading Either/Or, when all the different things that Ivan had said and written had come flooding back to me, assuming a new shape, bigger than I had suspected. It was happening again now: some pieces of some larger story that I could barely make out were flying into new positions, and I was remembering things I had forgotten, and putting them together differently, and all while I was sitting still and not going anywhere or doing anythingthough in another way I was hurtling north at five hundred miles an hour. At the lost baggage counter in Sheremetyevo-2, I was shown a laminated page with pictures of different suitcases and backpacks. None looked much like my convertible backpack, which had vanished at some stage of the journey. Pointing to the closest approximation, I wrote out, in the fake-seeming Cyrillic cursive that I had only ever used in Russian class, the geneticists convoluted address. The man at the counter glanced at the paper and said fine, the bag would be brought there tomorrow. Was that a possible outcome? I had no idea. But there was nothing more I could do here: the longer I lingered, hoping for some extra assurance, the more distinctly I felt the last ambient goodwill whooshing out of the room, like sand from an hourglass. I went out the only way there was, into the arrivals hall. The smells, the colors, the peoples flat and wary faces, were radically unfamiliaras if the plastic and the cigarettes and the light bulbs and the clothes had a different chemical makeup, and the people had eaten different food, and their clothes had been made in different factories, and the distance that separated them from my own existence was determined not just spatially, by things like biogeography and regional trade blocs, but also somehow by time. The lighting, the air quality, the heavy bronze sculpted ceiling that seemed about to fall on our heads: all lent the immediate surroundings the hazy amber cast of a 1970s photograph. The structures themselvesthe bronze panels, the black numberless clock, the pillars that resembled the skyscrapers on the cover of The Fountainheadseemed to connote a bygone futurism, the projection of a historical reality different from the one that had, to my knowledge, actually come to pass. That was what Russia had done: taken a fork in the road to a different future. For all my life there had been another world, and no one had come out, and no one had gone inuntil one day the borders turned out to be fictitious, the insurmountable barrier became nothing but a pack of cards, so that now you could walk right through the looking glass, into the world of backward Ns and Rs. With only my messenger bag, feeling light as a soul, I got into a Lada taxi and told the driver the address. OK, he said, and started driving. So it was true. There really was a whole country where people spoke the language from Eugene Onegin, the recombined components of which now rose up around me, on highway signs and license plates, on the sides of the prehistoric, post-historic, exhaust-spewing trucks. And I had willed myself into it. In the past, I had been in one country or another because of other people: my parents, Svetlana, Ivan, Sean. But I was in Russia because I had looked at the literatures of the world and made a choice. Nobody had especially wanted me to comeindeed, the customs officer who stamped my passport had left a distinct impression of wishing me to be elsewhereyet here I was. It was like when Isabel managed not to marry the guy with the cotton mills, and it was her first taste of victorybecause she had done what she preferred. Was this the decisive moment of my life? It felt as if the gap that had dogged me all my days was knitting together before my eyesso that, from this point on, my life would be as coherent and meaningful as my favorite books. At the same time, I had a powerful sense of having escaped something: of having finally stepped outside the script.
